An array of artistes across genres set to perform at the festival include contemporary musician Andy Muridzo, gospel singer Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, Kireni Zulu, sungura singer Tendai Dembo, TruBantu Tribe and others. Other popular artistes from theatre, dance and spoken word will also grace the festival.
