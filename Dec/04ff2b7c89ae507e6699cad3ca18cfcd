AWARD-WINNING South African hip-hop artiste Maya Wegerif — popularly known as Sho Madjozi — will be among the 18 entertainers set to perform at this year’s edition of the Neverland Music Festival set for Borrowdale Racecourse today. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The music fiesta, which has been voted as one of the top 10 festivals in Africa, is held annually in Harare every December under the theme: Together We Are Stronger. Festival director Jason Le Roux told NewsDay Life & Style that this year’s event has attracted 18 artistes from southern Africa, with Madjozi as the main attraction. “Sho Madjozi will be one of the acts performing at the festival on Saturday. This year, the festival hosts over 18 artistes from around Africa, including Sho Madjozi, Holly Rey, Kususa, Timo ODV, Jason Le Roux, Djembe Monks & Raydizz,” he said. “We will host pop-up restaurants, workshops, shisha and vape bars, chill out areas, silent discos and have one of the most advanced audio and visual displays on the continent.” Le Roux said after the show, the festival would have hosted over 100 international acts and an estimated 25 000 paying audiences. Sho Madjozi (pictured) has won multiple awards, including the BET Award for Best New International Artiste and Female Artiste of the Year award at the South African Music Awards last year after the release of the track, John Cena. The Tsonga rapper made history when she became the first female African artiste to walk away with the BET award for Best New International Act. She also bagged the Best Newcomer award at BET and Best Female Artiste award at the South African Music Awards. She was the first Mzansi female to win the Best International Act category at the BET Awards in Los Angeles earlier this year.
