Chicken Inn saw their chances of winning the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League evaporate despite their win over Herentals at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. FC Platinum’s yesterday’s win over Black Rhinos also means that Chicken Inn can no longer win the title, never mind what will happen on the final day of the campaign on Saturday,
The Zvishavane-based side moved to the top of the log after Caps United stumbled to a 3-2 defeat away to Ngezi Platinum Stars. FC Platinum moved to 59 points, with Caps on 58, while Chicken Inn have 56. The complication for Chicken Inn is that Caps United and FC Platinum cannot both lose on Saturday as they will be playing against each other. A draw between the top two sides will see FC Platinum winning the title, while a win for Caps United will be enough for them to pip the reigning champions. The best that Chicken Inn can attain is second position if Caps United fail to beat FC Platinum, but only if Chicken Inn win their last encounter. Chicken Inn can finish a point above Caps or with the same tally, but the 2015 champions have a better goal difference compared to the Green Machine. Chicken Inn’s win yesterday, which came through goals by Innocent Mucheneka in the first half and Valentine Kadonzvo in the second, condemned Herentals into the drop zone and the Harare-based side now needs to beat Bulawayo Chiefs on the last day to retain any hope of survival. Yesterday, Joey Antipas’ Chicken Inn played a chunk of the second half with 10 men after Passmore Bernard was dismissed for a head butt on Blessing Maunganidze on 58 minutes.
