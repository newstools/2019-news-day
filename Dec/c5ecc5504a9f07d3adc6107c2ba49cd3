MORE than 30 teams will battle for honours at an annual junior soccer tournament in Mutare as the Mai Hondo youth soccer jamboree explodes into life this weekend. BY SPORTS REPORTER The tournament starts today, while the finals are slated for Sakubva Stadium tomorrow. Although previously played by teams from Mutare and the surrounding areas, this year’s tournament will also feature boys and girls teams from Harare, Marondera and outlying rural areas in Manicaland province such as Buhera, Nyanga, Chipinge and Mutasa. And it is not just about soccer, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and corporates such as Population Services International (PSI), Padare Men’s Forum, Elevate Zimbabwe, Men in Health, the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council and Sportlan Zimbabwe will pitch tents offering male circumcision services as well as disseminating information on family planning, HIV and Aids and sexual reproductive health. “We are targeting the same population, which are the young girls and boys. The tournament always gives a great opportunity for us to offer our services to the community,” PSI district field officer for Mutare, Beauty Chikwanda said. Event organiser, Blessing Mutsaka, said: “The idea of partnering these NGOs is to fuse soccer with awareness on issues that often affect the youth. The tournament is a perfect opportunity for children to have fun, and also increase their alertness to critical health and psychological issues that form a daily part of their lives.” The tournament is in its fifth year and this year gained official recognition from football’s mother body Zifa, which donated balls to be distributed to participating teams. Teams will receive kits and training equipment, among other items.
