BY KENNETH NYANGANI Rusape Town Council (RTC) has started drilling boreholes in all of its 11 wards to avert a water crisis caused by power outages, after the town went for two weeks without electricity. RTC chairperson Laiton Sithole confirmed the development to NewsDay yesterday. He said council was failing to pump water at Jack Medium water works in Rusape due to power outages, and have engaged Zesa. “We have introduced a programme of drilling boreholes. We are drilling boreholes in all our 11 wards, but so far we have started working on three boreholes in three wards. We have a serious water crisis in Rusape and this needs to be addressed urgently,” he said “We tried to engage Zesa in 2018 to continuously supply us with electricity at our Jack Water works, but that has not been addressed.” Sithole said council was seeking partners for the project. Residents in Rusape are currently fetching water from unprotected sources. Rusape Concerned Residents Trust member Godfrey Mufuranhewe said council should consider solar pump stations. “True we are having severe water challenges in Rusape. We hope the situation will improve with these new boreholes, but why not move a step further and install solar pumped water systems,” he said “But at the moment, I am just happy with the decision which has been made by our council because as residents we fear waterborne diseases,” he added.
