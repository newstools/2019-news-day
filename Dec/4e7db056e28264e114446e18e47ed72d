BY PRAISEMORE SITHOLE MATOBO district has begun a quinoa pilot project with 54 farmers planting the drought tolerant crop to help improve food security in the drought ravaged district. The Organisation of Rural Association for Progress (ORAP) is supporting and sponsoring the project. Matobo ORAP district field coordinator Sibongukuhle Siziba told journalists during a tour of its projects that the district was the first in Zimbabwe to grow the crop. “We are the first in Zimbabwe to have been given the go ahead to plant quinoa and we have 54 farmers who have planted the crop in the district,” Siziba said. “The plant was tried by Midlands State University and was seen to be successful.” Siziba said the plant has edible brown or white seeds. “It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is not a true cereal. Its seeds are high in protein and fibre, and its young leaves are also nutritious and can be eaten as a vegetable, similar to spinach,” she said. “Quinoa is now grown in a number of countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Italy and China.” Siziba said the crop was drought tolerant and could be planted thrice annually. Matobo has successively suffered the effects of drought, which has been blamed on climate change.
