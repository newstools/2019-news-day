HARARE City eased their relegation worries after overcoming fellow Harare giants Dynamos in a Castle Lager Premiership tie at Rufaro Stadium yesterday. The win lifted them to 13th place on the log with 40 points, with one match remaining before the curtain comes down on the league calendar. However, their fate will only be decided on the last day of the league programme when they face off Ngezi Platinum. Lloyd Chitembwe’s men will still need to win their remaining match against Ngezi to be sure of safety. A draw might not suffice, considering that Chapungu, who are a rung behind them with 39 points and Herentals and Yadah, who are on 38 points each, all have realistic chances of survival. The Sunshine City Boys produced a dominant display against DeMbare, with striker William Manondo scoring a brace on either side of the break. Midfielder Moses Muchenje had converted from the penalty spot on 43 minutes after goalkeeper Simbarashe Chinani needlessly rushed from his goal line to impede Takudzwa Chimwemwe, who had breached the defence, but was far from a threatening position. That goal cancelled out Jarrison Selemani’s well-struck effort on 29 minutes. After the match, Chitembwe was a delighted man. “It’s a great relief. We had targeted to get three points and this is what is important at this stage. We got the win at the right moment. After conceding an equaliser, we reorganised and led again to secure maximum points,” he said. “I should give credit to the boys for getting the job done. We were too cautious, especially after leading and there is a tendency to make mistakes, but what is important is that we regrouped and restored the lead.”
