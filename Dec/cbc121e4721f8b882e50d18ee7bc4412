ZIMBABWEAN-born pop singer, Gemma Griffiths, yesterday said her recent collaboration with several other songbirds was centred on women supporting each other and also meant to honour men who have helped women to carve a niche in the music industry. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA The collaboration, titled Mambokadzi, features Ammara Brown, Tamy Moyo, Misred and Chengeto Brown.
Gemma (pictured) told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that she was happy to be in another successful collaboration. “Mambokadzi is all about women supporting women. We have such incredible women in the industry and in general, so we basically want to take this time to celebrate all of them for being mambokadzis in their own way,” she said. “It’s also about the men who build us up. There are such incredible men who put time and effort into helping us along. The song was produced by Reverb 7 and mixed by Simba Tags, two incredible men, who have helped a lot of women in their productions.” Gemma described Ammara as “a wonderful person and a great friend” with whom she decided to work, with incredible results. “I showed her my idea and we both loved the idea, so it was a very natural connection that we had and became a wonderful song to make together,” she said, adding that she has had amazing experiences with other artistes who include DJ Askren from Amsterdam, DJ Stavo, Charlie K and Winky D. “I am very blessed with the people that I have been able to work with and the responses that I have got from it.” Gemma, who released the song in line to the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, said the song was also meant to encourage people to respect women.
The song is already topping charts on Trace Africa and Trace UK.
