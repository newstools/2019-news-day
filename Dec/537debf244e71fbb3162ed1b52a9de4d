BY FREEEMAN MAKOPA THE Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) is confident that its representatives at the Zone Six Club Championships set for Lilongwe, Malawi, will do well. The championships, which are running until Saturday, have attracted top clubs drawn from countries within the southern Africa to compete in the men and women’s sections. ZVA president Ringisai Mapondera is optimistic that Zimbabwean teams will win gold in both the men and women’s sections. “The championships are already underway and one of our teams Manyame Falcons played their first game which they lost, but we are still confident that we will bring gold given that we have strong sides compared to other years,” he said. “We are a powerhouse in the sport and with the amount of training our clubs have had, we are sure that we will outclasses our opponents,” he said. Mapondera said the championship organisers have reduced the prize money. “This year, the prize money was reduced and the first place finishers will get US$500, the silver medalists earn $300 while for bronze you get US$200 for third place for both men and women’s teams. We have UZ Wolves, Support Unit and Harare City in the men’s category, while in the ladies we are being represented by UZ Wolves, Harare City and Manyame Falcons,” he added. Last year, UZ Wolves, in the men’s section, claimed silver medals and they will be looking to do better and clinch the main prize. A total of 24 teams are battling it out for honours in both categories. The teams of each gender will be divided into three pools of four team where the top two of each pool proceed to the second round.
