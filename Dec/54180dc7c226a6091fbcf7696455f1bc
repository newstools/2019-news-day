BY HENRY MHARA FC Platinum are interested in signing Triangle midfielder and Soccer Star of the Year first runner-up Ralph Kawondera, who they want to snatch as soon as his current deal runs out at the end of the month. The champions, according to sources, want to reinforce their midfield department after the departure of Farai Madhanhanga and Ali Sadiki who left for South Africa and Zambia, respectively. The departure of Madhanhanga in particular, left the Zvishavane-based side lightweight in that department. Their performance in the Caf Champions League have also been unimpressive in the group stages where they have so far lost both matches they have been involved in. Sources say the platinum miners have identified Kawondera as a player who can help solve their problems in midfield. “They want to sign Kawondera and negotiations are at an advanced stage. As soon as the transfer window opens, he will be joining FC Platinum. The player himself has told people close to him and teammates that he is joining FC Platinum next season,” said the source. According to the source, Kawondera is in the final year of his contract with Triangle. FC Platinum spokesperson Chido Chizondo confirmed that they were looking to bolster their squad, but could not give the names of the players that they were targeting. “We are considering various options, and we will make announcements at the right time,” Chizondo said. After losing some key players, FC Platinum were forced to infuse their juniors into the team. This hugely affected their rhythm in their bid to defend the title for the third consecutive time. They are currently second on the log, two points behind Caps United, with two games remaining in the season.
