BY SIBONGINKOSI MAPHOSA Philanthropist and retired psychiatric nurse, who specialised in dementia Sifiso Agbetorwoka, together with local psychiatric nurses and others who are in the diaspora on Saturday donated groceries to Ingutsheni Mental Health Hospital in Bulawayo. Agbetorwoka said they founded the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Action Group whose aim was to share knowledge and skills with colleagues at Ingutsheni who work with limited resources. “A group of us founded the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Action Group in November last year. We have nurses based in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada and our main objective is to share knowledge and skills with our colleagues at Ingutsheni hospital who do an amazing job with limited resources,” she said. Agbetorwoka said they wanted to improve the quality of life for people with mental health issues. The group visits Ingutsheni every month to donate clothes, blankets, sanitary wear, toiletries, cleaning detergents, books and snacks. She said this year they cooked and served lunch for inmates in all three wards at the hospital, unlike last year when they only hosted Christmas lunch for Khumalo ward patients. “This year we were quite ambitious as we hosted patients from all the wards adding up to 300 for Christmas lunch unlike last year when we only prepared lunch for Khumalo ward patients” she said. Agbetorwoka appealed to well-wishers to donate sugar beans, butternut, rice, cabbages, salad dressings, disposable spoons, vegetables, biscuits and juice to the institution.
Ingutsheni matron Vongai Chimbindi welcomed the donation. ”We are quite appreciative of the gesture shown by Ingutsheni friends. It is Christmas time and everyone expects love and receiving something. We are happy to have received that love,” she said.
