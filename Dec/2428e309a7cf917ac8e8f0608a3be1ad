by KENNEDY NYAVAYA NANJING, CHINA — A 15-member arts troupe consisting of former Dream Star talent show winners and finalists will today showcase their unique talents at the China Africa Cultural Exchange programme here. The group, which landed in the Asian country on Sunday as the sole African representatives, has been carrying out city tours, meeting other artistes and familiarising themselves with the city’s vast history in preparation for three full shows. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, talent show director Steve Zhao said the annual trip is a learning process for the youths who will tap into the advanced industry here for the betterment of their work back home. “Every year we are sending people to China to do this cultural exchange where they meet other artistes and new audiences,” he said. “We believe when we bring young artistes here they can learn from first-hand experience how China has been doing it and possibly take that back home to influence a much bigger and positive advancement on their artistic space.” Zhao also said since 2014, the talent show, hosted by Jacaranda Culture and Media Corporation (JCMC) in partnership with the Embassy of China in Zimbabwe, as well as the China Africa Economic and Culture Exchange Research Centre, has assisted dozens of artistes break onto the international scene  while also refining their work. “Everything that Dream Star tries to do is for the future of the country and its culture because we believe that culture is working with people and a nation without a culture cannot move forward,” he said, adding that they wanted to record more achievements. Meanwhile, JCMC artistic director Leonard Mapfumo said they will take the opportunity to market the country through art while also honing the novice artistes’ skills of handling such big stages. “I believe that the entertainment industry carries the biggest ambassadors so I hope through our performances we will leave (an appetite) in the people (to crave to know) where we come from and make them want to come and experience the bigger picture,” he said.
