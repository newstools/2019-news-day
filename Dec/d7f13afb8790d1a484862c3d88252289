CASES of politicisation of food aid are on the rise particularly in Masvingo, according to a report by human rights watchdog, the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP). BY NQOBANI NDLOVU Nearly eight million Zimbabweans in both rural and urban areas need food aid after the worst drought to hit the southern African country in 30 years, according to a recent report by United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Hilal Elver. “However, the vulnerability of this population is being exacerbated by the blatant politicisation of aid and deprivation for those perceived to be opposition supporters,” the ZPP said in its latest report. “This was evidenced by the rise in the number of cases related to food and other aid to 55 recorded during the month of November up from 33 in October. Masvingo province recorded the highest number of this violation at 22 followed by Mashonaland Central province with 10.” Ruling Zanu PF supporters have on several occasions been accused of being the main culprits in politicising food aid in connivance with traditional leaders. The party always denies the charge. United Nations Special Rapporteur Hilal Elver in her report said: “Most vulnerable segments of society, including the elderly, children and women, are forced to rely on early marriage, and commercial sex to obtain food”, among others. “This kind of struggle for subsistence affects their physical wellbeing and self-respect. It creates behaviour and conditions that violate their most fundamental human rights,” Hilal said.
