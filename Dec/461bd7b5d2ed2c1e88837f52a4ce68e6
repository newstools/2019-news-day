By Freeman Makopa Bulawayo-based handball team, Ajax emerged as the overall winners of this year’s edition of Blissmass Handball tournament held at the weekend. The tournament received a low turnout, with some powerhouses in the game failing to attend due to logistical challenges. Zimbabwe Handball Federation president Stewart Sanhewe said the shortage of fuel contributed to the low turnout. “Most out of teams failed to travel because of fuel shortages. Although the tournament was a success, it lacked competitiveness because some of the big teams did not participate. “We are looking for sponsorship and some of the top companies in the country have responded positively. This year, they supported the tournament and we are looking forward to forge long-term relationships as we make steps to enhance the growth of the sport in the country,” he said.
