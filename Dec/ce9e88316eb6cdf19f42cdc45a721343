BY TERRY MADYAUTA TELONE gaffer Rahman Gumbo has heaped praise on the 2019 Soccer Star of the Year finalist King Nadolo, who has established himself as the club’s anchor since joining the club during the mid-season transfer window. Nadolo has been inspirational in the WiFi Boys’ survival campaign, scoring ten crucial goals that have helped lift the team from the relegation zone although they are still not quite safe. They sit two points above the drop zone with two more matches to play. “The boy is maturing well, he has been doing very well for us as a team. We had a mammoth task ahead of us when we both arrived at the team,“ Gumbo said. “Of all the signings we made this season, Nadolo has proved to be worth it. He scores crucial goals for the team. “In fact, it is his work rate that makes him a lot different from the rest of the team, but whatever he has achieved is a product of team work,“ Gumbo said. Nadolo was named among the Soccer Star of the Year finalists. He could still win another award as he is in hot pursuit of top goalscorer Clive Augusto (14 goals), for the Golden Boot award. “The award is a motivation but more is to come. I am working towards the Golden Boot now. It is still very much achievable. “I know that there is stiff competition for that award, but I believe it is achievable in the remaining two games, “said Nadolo. The WiFi Boys’ next assignment will be against Hwange before they conclude their season with a date against Chicken Inn.
