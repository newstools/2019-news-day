BY SHARON SIBINDI ZIMBABWEAN fashion designer, Saneliso Mpofu of Sanah Designs has been featured on the 5 top Best Men’s GQ Magazine in South Africa soon after taking part in the recently held Mozambique Fashion Week in Maputo. Sanah Designs showcased alongside international designers from Portugal, Italy, Botswana, Kenya, South Africa, Mozambique and Japan where she displayed her 2020 Autumn-Winter collection. “It was a great experience and I got to mix and mingle with other international designers. The standards of the show were so amazing and it really opened up my eyes and I really got inspired by other collections that I saw there,” she said. “People loved my work and I got to be featured on 5 top Best Men’s Wear Collection GQ Magazine in South Africa.”
Mpofu said she felt so humbled to end the year on a high note, giving credit to Global Citizen, Gilmore Tee who paved the way for her. “I feel blessed and humbled to be part of such a big fashion week representing Zimbabwe and it’s all, thanks to my public relations officer Gilmore Tee for creating such an opportunity for me,” she said.
“I look forward to improving my work, work so hard and expand my brand, expecting to showcase on more international platforms in 2020.” She said her Autumn-Winter 2020 collection was inspired by vintage 1970s fashion ladies suits which had belts to define their waists and florals. “This collection is about defining men’s waists and feminine fashion details like florals and contracts which used to be worn by a woman in the 1970s,”she said.
