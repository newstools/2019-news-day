BY SHARON SIBINDI MOTORSPORT Zimbabwe is investigating the race car accident which claimed 7-year-old Kelvin Kwangwari’s life on Saturday in Bulawayo. The Grade 2 pupil, who was hit and dragged by a car at the three-hour Bulawayo Endurance Race at the Bulawayo Motorsport Park along Victoria Falls Road, was confirmed dead on admission at Mpilo Central Hospital and was buried yesterday. Motorsport Zimbabwe president, Ralph Stead, said investigations on the cause of the accident were ongoing. “As a very safety conscious organisation, Motorsport Zimbabwe will continue to thoroughly investigate the incident and take necessary steps to avoid such an incident reoccurring. Thank you to everyone who has sent their condolences and support,” he said in a statement yesterday. “The incident at the 3-hour race in Bulawayo was a tragic one in which a young boy, Kelvin, lost his life. This is the only such incident that has occurred in the past 50-plus years of circuit racing in Zimbabwe at either the Bulawayo or Harare circuit.” He said three people were taken to hospital on Saturday. “There has been a lot of speculation over the number of the injured. MARS has confirmed that only three people were taken to hospital, including young Kelvin, who passed away some time after being admitted,” he said. “Unfortunately, he was only attended to a while after admission due to shortage of staff. The other two injured people were treated and released thereafter. Kelvin was buried on Tuesday and the Motorsport community have assisted Kelvin’s family with the expenses incurred.” “Our thoughts are with Kelvin’s family and the two injured spectators to whom we wish speedy recovery. Our thoughts also extend to Richard Robinson, who was involved in this very unfortunate incident.”
