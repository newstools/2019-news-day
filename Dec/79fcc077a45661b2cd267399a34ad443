by style reporter JOHANNESBURG — Most South Africans have been in a state of elation since Miss South Africa Zozibini Tunzi bagged the Miss Universe crown on Sunday night. The country’s celebs also joined the party. President Cyril Ramaphosa, actress Nomzamo Mbatha and former Miss Universe Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters are just some of the A-listers who have publicly congratulated the beauty queen. Some famous faces have taken things further, not only sharing posts celebrating Tunzi on social media, but jokingly taking part of the credit for her win. These included comedian Lesego Tlhabi, also known as Coconut Kelz, who shared snaps she had taken with Tunzi on Instagram, captioning them: “I’m not saying this is why she won. But I’m not saying it.” Idols SA judge Somizi posted a funny video he had filmed with Tunzi before the pageant, where the duo practised what would happen if her name was announced as the winner. He captioned the clip: “I joked about it into existence and the Universe literally responded.”
