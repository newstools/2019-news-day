BY FREEMAN MAKOPA AWARD-WINNING gospel sensation Janet Manyowa says her fans can expect a new album next year following the release two weeks ago of a video for her new single, Ndimi. Her husband-cum-manager, Munyaradzi Manyowa, said Ndimi was culled from the yet-to-be-named forthcoming album, describing the single as a Christmas gift for their fans. “It’s the start of our new season as Team Janet and if you see us releasing these single tracks, just know that we are preparing for an album and this time around we will release it early next year,” Manyowa said. “In this video, we were trying to add a new flavour in order to release something interesting for our fans as we are in a growth trajectory. There are definitely plans for a new album, and #ndimi is the first single of that album.” The current release is a declarative song in which Janet proclaims the greatness of God who is able to do the impossible. “Hard work, diligence and focus are the secrets behind good videos. We also thrive on having a very good Team. #teamJMM is fantastic; everybody knows they have a part to play in achieving the vision,” Manyowa added. The new track was directed by Kudzanayi “K Mane” Maneswa and Algy Chiremba Madzura. The video to the track clocked 17 000 YouTube views in 20 hours after its release. Manyowa recently scooped four awards at the Permican Awards.
