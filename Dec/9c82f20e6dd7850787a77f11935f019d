FILM lovers are in for an early Christmas treat as renowned filmmaker Melgin Tafirenyika’s Light Image Productions is set to premiere the much-awaited  75-minute-long feature film, Chapungu, at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare on December 19. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Tafirenyika , who recently attended the Limpopo International Film Festival with his popular film 5th Anniversary, has decided to end the year with Chapungu, which mirrors societal fights over inheritance. “It’s not by coincidence that it’s premiering this month, especially ahead of Christmas. We thought this could be the greatest Christmas present to all film lovers who will afford to make it to the venue on the day,” he said, adding that tickets for the film were going for $50 and those who bought three will get two more for free. Chapungu — the main character played by Lorraine Mushati — is a woman, who following the death of her husband, greedily fights to grab the family wealth instead of letting it go to the younger sister-in-law Chido (Eunice Tava). This fight for inheritance creates enmity, resulting in witchcraft accusations being levelled against the mother-in-law Mandivamba (Stella January). Subsequently this paves Chapungu’s way to victory and a lot is revealed thereafter as the film unfolds. The film, co-written by Mapfumo Katsaya and Munashe Chitsiga also features Tendai Maduwa, Charles Kamara, Beauty Nkomazana and Charles Nechironga. Tafirenyika has also produced I Will Marry Myself (2012), Sour Milk (2015) and Chihombiro (2017). All the films are screening on DSTV’s Zambezi Magic (Channel 162).
