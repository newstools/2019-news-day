BY PATRICIA SIBANDA AGRO-MANUFACTURING company Twine and Cordage on Thursday last week officially handed over a $100 000 greenhouse project to King George VI (KGVI), a specialised school for pupils with disabilities. Twine and Cordage owner Buz Davies said the garden project would bring revenue to the school. “King George VI is very close to my heart and it is very close to the Bulawayo community. When one goes around the school you will note that the children don’t give up that easily and that on its own will make you realise that they can do more,” Davies said. “This is not just a project that will only provide food, but it will enable the school to make money through selling of vegetables and will fund other projects around the school. This is the first project at KGVI, but not the only project around the nation.” He said the project was budgeted at around $100 000, but he will keep assisting the school when need arises. “I do not have a specific figure as such since the rates are not stable, but we are looking at about $80 000 to $100 000 that we stashed in for the project,” Davies said. KGVI head Perseverance Hadebe said the project  will enable the school to grow crops  all year round for the learners’ feeding programme and for sale. She called on more well-wishers to help keep the school running.
