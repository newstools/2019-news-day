BY SHARON SIBINDI SOUTH AFRICAN gospel choir Joyous Celebration’s co-founder Lindelani Mkhize will be part of the panel of judges at this year’s edition of the Clash of Hub Choirs scheduled for December 15 at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) hall 4 in Bulawayo. Mkhize will share notes with local gospel musician Charles Charamba and former joyous lead singer Hlengiwe Ntombela Mthethwa on the judge’s panel, at the event organised by Harvest House International (HHI). The sixth edition of the concert is set to feature about 20 choirs from different hubs. The HHI music leader, Sukoluhle Luphahla, yesterday said the thrust of the concert is to groom and nurture talent and win souls. “In 2014, Bishop Colin and Senior Reverend Sarah Nyathi introduced what was known as the Clash of Hub choirs. This was aimed at grooming and investing in music talent within the church so that musicians would get a chance to present themselves with confidence,” she said. She said the competition’s grand money prize is $105 000, with three winning choirs set to share the money. “We will have the winner, first runner-up and second runner-up. We will also award instant prices to those who will do well during the day. The judges will look at the structure, stage presence, balance and blending in terms of vocals with the band, choreography, creativity, presentation, size, their interaction with the crowd, grooming of the choir and uniform, as well as originality,” she said. Guests at the event will also be entertained by Takesure Zamar Ncube and Wenyasha Chingono, who will minister alongside the choirs.
