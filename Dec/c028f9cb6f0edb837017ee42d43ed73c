BY KENNETH NYANGANI NEWLY-PROMOTED Premiership side Tenax striker Farai Mugunwa scooped two awards at the Eastern Region Division One Football League end of the season awards. The Eastern Region administration named 11 players who excelled in the 2019 season. Mugunwa was crowned the Player of the Year and the league’s top goalscorer with 15 goals. Speaking to NewsDay Sport yesterday, the stocky striker (29) said he hoped to make an impact in the top division next year. He is not new to the topflight league having featured for Flame Lily in 2015. “I think as a player I have matured to play in the Premier League, but I know it is challenging.

Now we are in the Premier League, it is time to prove that I am a good striker, I am ready for the new challenge,” he said. Other players who received awards include Congolese Frank Adusei (Melfort), Tatenda Chihava (Masvingo Pirates), Nigel Mudimu (Surrey Football Club), goalkeeper Simbarashe Ngosi (Tenax), Tatenda Kureti (FC Makaha), Shaun Sabuneti (Melfort Football Club), Charles Teguru (Buffaloes), Benevelio Mukwena (Mutare City), Tafara Ginya (Chiredzi) and Sam Nyakudya (Green Fuels).
