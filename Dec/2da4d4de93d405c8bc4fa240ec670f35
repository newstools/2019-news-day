TOP gospel musician Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave has endorsed comedienne Tyra “Madam Boss” Chikoko’s new television series — Dudzai — and described the latter as a phenomenal woman, who did not allow social media bullying to stop her. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The production was officially launched last week, with Madam Boss brand manager Ngoni Munetsiwa saying their fans would have an entertainment overload this festive season. Zvakavapano-Mashavave, who attended the launch, saluted Madam Boss for remaining focused on her dream amid growing social media bullying. Describing the comedienne as her “church person of the month”, the gospel musician said she was proud of her colleague. “With the way the social media culture is so hostile, I applaud her for upholding her dream till it came to life. We have a social media culture that strangles life out of gifts, but this woman nursed her dream and today I am proud of her,” she said on her official Instagram page. A victim of social media bullying herself, Zvakavapano-Mashavave said an “opinionated public” was the greatest challenge for any entertainer. “The tendency is for the public to discourage and attack the dreamer for their innocent dream, which was deposited by God in their private space. This is where a lot of us develop cold feet and hang the boots because it’s quite an exhausting journey,” she said. The Makomborero hitmaker said a lot of gifted people failed to maximise their potential due to fear of victimisation. “The world has readily cut out templates for gifts when it has no idea how God shaped them. As a result, so many are cocooned and muffled away in a little box where they can’t spread their wings and fly to greater heights, the way Tyra has,” she said.
