BY NQOBANI NDLOVU BULAWAYO MDC councillors Tinashe Kambarami and Silas Chigora have withdrawn assault charges against Bulawayo City Council (BCC) town clerk Christopher Dube. The two had filed counter-assault charges against Dube after Bulawayo magistrate Tinashe Tashaya had acquitted them of assaulting the town clerk at his offices in July. Kambarami, then deputy mayor, and Silas Chigora had been charged with assaulting Dube while serving him with a letter of suspension. However, Tashaya acquitted the pair who went on to file counter assault charges against the town clerk. Chigora said they decided to withdraw the charges for the “sake of the city’s progress”. “We have met and talked over the issue and agreed to let bygones be bygones so that we concentrate on building the city. We have a plethora of challenges in the city which require us to work together as one team and deliver quality service to the people of Bulawayo,” Chigora said. Dube was set to appear at the Bulawayo Magistrates’ Court facing assault charges. “We have agreed to be magnanimous and accept each other’s mistakes and take our past as a lesson to all of us into the future. We agreed to set a good example as city fathers in terms of forgiveness,” Chigora said. In July this year, Kambarami, then acting mayor, suspended Dube over allegations of mismanaging council funds and abuse of office. Dube’s dramatic suspension, however, triggered violent demonstrations from the town clerk’s sympathisers, who besieged the City Hall denouncing both Kambarami and Chigora for their actions.
