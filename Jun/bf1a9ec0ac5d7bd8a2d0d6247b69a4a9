BY PRECIOUS CHIDA HIP-HOP and RnB artiste, Clyde Macathur Chirikure, who goes by the moniker Clyde Banks, yesterday said too many amateurs were diluting the art of hip-hop thereby denying the music genre to grow in the country. Chirikure told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that hip-hop was a complex genre but was attracting many upstarts with little knowledge about it. “Zimbabwean hip-hop music is growing but people who just see the popular artistes on TV and think they can do it too are diluting and saturating the genre. A lot of people who do not really understand the art behind composing hip-hop music and just want the fame are hindering it from growing bigger,” he said. Chirikure, who is a holder of a degree in cinematography from the University of Botswana, said artistes needed to learn music and be professional to add value to music. He said his music was drawn from life experiences. “My music is all about my life, I sing about my struggles and pains and there are people who would resonate to that and I feel it’s a great accomplishment when
people can relate to your music wherever they are,” he said. This year alone he has released three videos —Turner Mofasa with Fucci, Dzivarasekwa featuring Check Game and Rap Game with Barz. The rapper said his lifelong dream was to establish a system that creates income and not just opportunities to the coming generation.
