BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER YOUTHFUL gospel musician Mathias Mhere has urged his fans to come in their numbers for the launch of his eighth album — Greater than Solomon — which is scheduled to be launched at The Venue this Friday. Mhere told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that his team was ready for the launch where Tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira will be the guest of honour. Mhere said all artistes featured on the album, except celebrated Malawian gospel singer Skeffa Mulongoti Chimoto, will be part of the launch, which will also be graced by Prophet Freddy, Bishop Mabhiza and, most likely, MDC leader Nelson Chamisa. Chamisa was among the honoured guests at the launch of Panogara Nyasha last year. “Minister Mupfumira will be the guest of honour. It will also attract big names, not only in politics and business, but even in the house of the Lord, we are also attracting big names. This time it is a little bit different,” Mhere said. Speaking on some of the songs on the album, Mhere said Hembe Mubhero (second-hand clothes) was about parents giving counsel to their children about the importance of treasuring their bodies. “The parents don’t want their children to be treated as second-hand clothes that anyone can just pick up and throw back on the ground. It’s a gospel song about treasuring one’s body,” Mhere said. In the track Kamushini (Little Machine), Mhere said the persona would be saying he does not have the devil’s DNA as the devil was responsible for most of problems in the world, including planting hatred and division among people. “He is a little machine that creates problems,” he said. “But the song Jakuchichi simply speaks to a deluge of indescribable blessings.”
