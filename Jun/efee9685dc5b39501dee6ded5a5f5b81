BY TERRY MADYAUTA THE Zimbabwe National Youth and Paralympic Games that were postponed last year following a typhoid outbreak in Gweru have been slated for August. The Under-23 category and open age group for the paralympic athletes will take place between July 27 and August 3 while the U-18 category runs from August 4 to 10. More than 2 000 athletes and officials from the country’s provinces are expected to converge in the Midlands capital. Participants will compete in 19 sporting disciplines that include soccer, athletics, handball, boxing, tennis, netball, volleyball, cricket, baseball and
basketball, among others. “The first block made up of U-23 now known as the virtual  provinces and paralympic sport codes runs from July 27 to August 3 and the second block made up of U-18s, runs from August 4-10,” said Shepherd Mukanhaira who is part of the games’ organising committee. These games used to mainly focus on the U-20 age group but the re-branded games will now encompass the U-23’s, where successful athletes will be selected for
high level training and exposure. Meanwhile, preparations for the sporting festival are already at an advanced stage since they continued even when they were postponed last year.
