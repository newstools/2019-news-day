BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO THE wait is going to be a bit longer for film lovers who were expecting to watch the much-awaited film Lord of Kush after the organisers of its premiere shifted the dates from June 29 to July 27, citing the need to perfect the production before unveiling it to the public. Lord of Kush producer and co-director Tendai Maduwa told NewsDay Life & Style that soon after its premiere at Theatre in the Park in Harare, the film would also go on a national tour. “We have moved the premiere of Lord of Kush to July 27 to perfect the final product. We have a lot of visual effects (vfx), sound draining and editing, colour grading and subtitles we are working on. Vfx is being done in Cape Town,” he said. “We sincerely apologise to all film lovers. The film will go on tour to all provinces in the country and if everything goes according to plan, we will then screen it beyond the
borders. We already started selling tickets on Monday.” Maduwa has, however, justified his choice to host the film premiere at Theatre in the Park against the popular home of films Ster-Kinekor, describing the former venue as a “home” for artists. “Theatre in the Park is an artists’ venue with a favourable environment and to me it is like home. I have been using it during rehearsals for the same project without paying a dime. So it is my home. It was designed as a 250-seater theatre, but if fully packed it accommodates 300 so it’s even bigger than some cinemas around the capital,” he said. The film, Lord of Kush, themed around the massacre of school children at Peshawar School in Pakistan, features three-year-old actress Candice Maduwa as well as renowned local and international thespians.
