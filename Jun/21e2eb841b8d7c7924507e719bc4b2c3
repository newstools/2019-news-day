TOP sungura ace Alick Macheso has criticised fellow singer Josphat Somanje for snubbing his late brother Daiton’s commemoration gig held at Rudhaka Stadium on Saturday night. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Daiton succumbed to suspected meningitis in 2015 at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals. He was 50. Josphat, who was on the list of several performers billed to entertain patrons on the night to celebrate the life of this brother, with who he co-founded Pengaudzoke Band in the late 90s. “I did not see him (Josphat). Where is he? Is he asleep? He should be here. I am confused and worried about his absence,” Macheso said during his perfomance at the event. This is not the first time that Josphat has behaved in such a manner, as last year he again snubbed the album launch of Daiton’s eldest son, Faheem. During the commemoration gig, Faheem took revellers down memory lane as he performed most of Pengaudzoke Band’s  hit songs, including imitating his father’s dance moves. In an interview with NewsDay Life &Style, Faheem said he was disappointed that his uncle had not performed at the event. “He was supposed to perform, but he did not come. I do not know why he did not turn-up. I tried to call him, but he did not pick the call. Even those who were organising the event called him, but he was not picking,” he said. Efforts to get a comment from Josphat were fruitless, as he failed to pick-up calls from NewsDay Life & Style by the time of going to print.
