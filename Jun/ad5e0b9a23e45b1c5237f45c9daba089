TRIANGLE are angling for the services of Chapungu forward Allen Tavarwisa as they seek to bolster their squad ahead of the 2019/2020 Caf Confederations. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The Lowveld side won the ticket to represent the country in the second tier continental inter-club competition after winning the 2018 Chibuku Super Cup. An impeccable source told NewsDay Sport yesterday that Mangwiro recently approached Chapungu seeking Tavarwisa’s transfer during the mid-season break to bolster his strike-force ahead of the Confederations Cup. “They want Allan (Tavarwisa) during the transfer window so that they can boost their team in terms of experience for the Confederations Cup,” the source said. “And the initial moves have already been made, but it remains to be seen if he will be released by his current club considering that for the last couple of seasons, he has been a key player in the squad.” Tavarwisa has been Chapungu’s reliable goalscorer in the last three seasons. Currently, the stocky forward is the club’s leading goalscorer, with five goals to his name. Triangle are also reportedly targeting a number of players that also include Herentals’ budding gem Juan Mutudza.
Reports also indicate that Lameck Nhamo’s return to the Sugar Boys is imminent as he looks to leave PSL defending champions FC Platinum, whom he joined last year ahead of their Caf Champions League campaign. The 30-year-old has failed to replicate the sterling form that earned him Soccer Star of the Year finalist and has seen him become a bench warmer at FC Platinum, with Perfect Chikwende and Albert Eonde preferred ahead of him.
While Triangle will be looking to atone for a season they have been poor performers, coach Taurai Mangwiro is targeting to assemble a squad that will make a mark on their maiden African safari bow.
