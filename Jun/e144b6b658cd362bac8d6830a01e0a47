BY KENNETH NYANGANI POLICE in Manicaland province have launched a manhunt for eight suspected armed robbers who raided a Chipinge woman’s home on Monday and got away with US$24 000, ZWL$240 and R18 000. Pamela Penyakufa from Nyakumwa village under Chief Matema, was asleep when the daring robbers besieged her house. Manicaland provincial police spokesperson Inspector Tavhiringwa Kakohwa confirmed the incident. He said the robbers also went away with 240 litres of diesel and five cellphones  belonging to the complainant. The incident happened on June 10 at around 9pm when eight robbers scaled a precast security wall to gain entry into Penyakufa’s homestead. Kakohwa said the robbers, who were armed with two pistols, knives, machetes and hammers, found two men, Danmore Nkomo and Clydide Quinton,  sleeping on the
verandah. They reportedly tied Quinton and Nkomo’s hands and threatened to kill them if they resisted. At that time, Penyakufa woke up after hearing Nkomo screaming and rushed outside to investigate, only to meet the robbers who allegedly force-marched her back
into the house. They allegedly demanded cash and she surrendered US$24 000, R18 000 and ZWL$240. Kakohwa urged the public not to keep large sums of money in their homes.
