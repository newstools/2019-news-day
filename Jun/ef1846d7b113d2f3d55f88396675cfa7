AFTER the successful premiere of The Adventures of Robert Moffatt theatre piece last month, Sunduza Dance Theatre are now set to take the production to the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa, which will run from June 27 to July 4, NewsDay Life & Style has learnt. BY SHARON SIBINDI The production exposes the strategies employed by missionaries in Zimbabwe’s colonisation, with the first British missionary, Robert Moffat, at the centre. Sunduza Dance Theatre director Charles Banda confirmed the development. “We had a successful premiere of our act at Bulawayo Theatre last month. We are now raising our Zimbabwean flag higher by taking the same production to the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, South Africa,” he said. “This is our second successful team-building project as we had another historical play, Voices from the Rocks – The Story of the Matopos, at the same festival.” Banda said the cast of nine will leave the country on June 23 and will be at the fiesta for 10 days. “We feel excited because Sunduza has been preserving the heritage and culture, especially the history of Matabeleland, through theatre and dance,” he said. “These type of festivals mean so much to the group as we gain more knowledge from others, meet different people who teach us team work in preparation for bigger arts festivals that we hope to attend in future.”
