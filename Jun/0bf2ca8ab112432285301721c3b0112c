London (CNN Business) — Toyota is forming new partnerships with other carmakers and battery producers as it seeks to win the race to electric and autonomous cars.   In a show of its seriousness, the world’s second largest carmaker on Friday moved forward by five years its goal of having electrified vehicles account for roughly half of sales. “Both Subaru and Toyota are required to conduct technological development with a sense of speed across a broader-than-ever spectrum of initiatives,” the statement said. Cooperation with Subaru may help Toyota meet its new goal of dramatically boosting the number of hybrid or electric vehicles it sells to 5.5 million a year by 2025. Its previous target was 2030. The company is also working to make sure it has enough batteries to power those cars, announcing Friday that it has agreed to partner with five new battery suppliers.
