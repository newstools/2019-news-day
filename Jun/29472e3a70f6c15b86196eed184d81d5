BY SPORTS REPORTER TRIANGLE . . . . . . (0)2 MUSHOWANI . . . . (0)1 Triangle gaffer Taurai Mangwiro yesterday heaved a huge sigh of relief after his side collected maximum points against Mushowani Stars in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Gibbo Stadium. The Lowveld side had failed to collect maximum points from five matches. And yesterday, the match nearly ended in a draw before striker Patrick Magegehla scored in the 90th minute for the home side to trigger wild celebrations at Gibbo. Triangle dominated the first half, pinning the visitors in their own half with Collins Dhuwa’s shot missing the target by a few inches on 23 minutes. Praise Tonha came close on 39 minute, but his header off Ralph Kawondera brushed the upright post. The second half turned out to be a balanced affair, but Triangle drew first blood on 71 minutes through Kawondera, but their celebrations only lasted five minutes as the visitors restored parity. With the match heading for a draw and another disappointing result for the home side, Magegehla then scored a beautiful goal to beat the final whistle. Mangwiro praised his team’s fighting spirit. “I am pleased with the team’s fighting spirit. The players continued fighting and the three points will give my team the much-needed confidence,” he said. “I was very sure that one day, we are going to win, but we will continue to work hard.”
