BY FREEMAN MAKOPA TRENDING Zimdancehall chanter Jah Signal is set to travel to Canada later this month for a show as he continues to gain traction on the global stage. He will perform together with sultry songbird Cindy Munyavi at the Miss Zimbabwe-US pageant held on May 25 at the Doubletree Hotel in Chicago. The Stonyeni hit-maker, who has stolen the limelight due to his entrancing dance moves that include dare-devil antics of hanging on the trusses of a stage, told NewsDay Life & Style that his music has attracted massive following. “We have witnessed a huge turnout during our previous tours, especially in the United States, where I am scheduled to return by public demand. But our attention now is on the Canada tour and we happy that some of our fans in the US told us that they will follow us to Canada,” he said. “I have just released a video for my song, Ishe, which I will also perform in Canada. Things are moving on well and we have fans on our side, so there is nothing to fear.” The musician said he was currently in the studio working on a new production which will be released year-end. “We’re working on our Singles Vol 2 Collection which is called Jah Signal and Friends which will be out towards the end of the year,” he said. Apart from performing in various countries, Jah Signal said he was eyeing collaborations with international artistes and was discussing logistics with a number of them. “I am working on something big, but I will tell you as soon as it is finalised,” said the artiste who was bred in Harare’s Kuwadzana suburb, adding that he never saw himself as one of the best musician in the country due to challenges that are associated with upcoming musicians. “I didn’t think I would be a musician one day because I used to write some jazz lyrics, but with God I saw myself being transformed into a full-blown artiste and I want to urge upcoming artiste to be focused on their works and not be affected by negative publicity.”
