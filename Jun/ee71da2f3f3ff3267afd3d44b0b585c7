The album will have 26 songs in three main languages, being English, Ndebele and Shona. “It is a mixture of praise, worship and ministry songs. The songs are in various  genres to cater for different preferences  which range  from reggae ,jazz, afro-jazz, afro-pop, kwaito to soft rock,” she said. “The product will be available in DVD and CD formats as well as on online stores such as Apple music, Spotify and YouTube.” She said the DVD would be available for sale in August 30 when the album launch is set to take place . This year’s Clash of Choirs, she added, was set for August 31 at the ZITF grounds where at least 20 choirs would participate.
