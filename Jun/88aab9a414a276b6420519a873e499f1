BY KENNETH NYANGANI Information Communication Technology and Courier Services deputy minister Jenfan Muswere yesterday said Parliament should continue to play its oversight role without hindrance to ensure sustained engagement, accountability and transparency. He made the remarks in Nyanga at the start of a three-day workshop for members of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on ICT, who are being sensitised on tariff and quality services by the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz). “Gone are the days when parliamentary portfolio committee meetings used to be turfs for political grandstanding and perceived witch hunting,” Muswere said “The role of ICTs in fostering economic transformation cannot be over-emphasised. As you are aware, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has enunciated a vision which aims to ensure that
Zimbabwe becomes an upper-middle income economy by 2030. “ICTs are a key catalyst in attaining vision 2030 as they are pivotal in enabling socio-economic development. This, therefore, calls for concerted efforts and collaboration in a bid to create an enabling environment for the generality of Zimbabweans who we serve.” He said mobile broadband population in the country now stood at 84 %. “We hope we will be 100% before 2030. In achieving the goal of universality, issues of service become critical, hence the need for this workshop to unpack tariff and quality of service issues,” Muswere said. Potraz director-general Gift Machengete said: “As a nation, our growth and development is embedded in our collaborative efforts. As a country, our progress is dependent upon our ability
to work together.”
