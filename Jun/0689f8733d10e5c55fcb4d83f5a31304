ALL is set for the start of the 2019 World Blood Donor Day commemorations set begin tomorrow and end on July 6, when national celebrations will be held, the National Blood Services Zimbabwe (NBSZ) has said. BY VANESSA GONYE In an interview, NBSZ spokesperson Esther Masundah told NewsDay that a number of activities had been lined up for the commemorations, among them traditional blood drives and milestone donor award ceremonies. She said the country was going to take part at the global event which kicks off in Rwanda today. “Locally, we have set  aside tomorrow as the blood donation day, where we are encouraging people from all over to visit the NBSZ static clinics. To those who are able to also have blood drives, we have as many people as possible donating. It’s also a day where we are going to be celebrating with the milestone donors and thanking all those who have been saving lives,” Masundah said. “We have also set aside the 14th as a red day for blood donors. So we are encouraging blood donors who are going to be visiting our clinics to be wearing red in solidarity with all other blood donors around the world. Rwanda has also adopted the concept of the Red Day, which they observed yesterday.” NBSZ head of planning and recruitment Tichaona Saira called upon people to turn up in their numbers to support the cause. “We are having two blood drives or mobile teams for Harare, one team at Nyika in Goromonzi and the other at Nissan Clover motors in Msasa. We urge people to come and give blood at our static clinics, one along Mazowe Street and the other at Joina City, second floor, where we are inviting all blood donors who are due to give blood on the day and new donors to come and give blood,” he said.
