LEFT-ARM seamer Fred Klaassen has been named in The Netherlands squad that will contest an ODI/T20I series against Zimbabwe later this month. The ‘Oranje’ and Zimbabwe will play each other in two ODIs and two T20Is between the 19th and 25th June. The last time the two countries met in an official ODI was during the 2003 World Cup; Zimbabwe won that encounter by 99 runs. During the ICC World T20 in India in 2014, Zimbabwe also beat The Netherlands, this time by 5 wickets. With the World Cup Qualifiers (Dubai, October 2019) and the 2020-22 ICC World Cup Super League not too far away, the series against Zimbabwe is a “great opportunity for players trying to establish themselves” in The Netherlands squad, according to the KNCB. Netherlands squad in full Pieter Seelaar , Max O’Dowd, Tobias Visée, Ben Cooper, Bas de Leede, Wesley Barresi, Roelof van der Merwe, Scott Edwards, Paul van Meekeren, Fred Klaassen, Vivian Kingma, Brandon Glover, Saqib Zulfiqar.
