BY SHARON SIBINDI BULAWAYO socialite Gilmore Tee Moyo (pictured) is back on local television as host and mentor  of a model reality television show Strut n Pose that premiered on national television ZBCTV on May 26. A Paper Bag Africa official, Charlotte Sengu confirmed the development to NewsDay. “On the show, 15 models will battle it out to become the ultimate model each season. The show takes models through a variety of challenges cutting across editorial, commercial and television, with some of the challenges getting them out of the comfort zone,” she said. “The reality show (Strut n Pose) is produced by award-winning video director Andy Cutta and renowned fashion designer Maita Marimo.”
Gilmore Tee said he looks forward to sharing his journey because he has not been on weekly television for a while. “I have not been on weekly television for over a year-and-a-half, so this is exciting. Strut n Pose really falls in the space I work in on a daily basis, fashion, media and panel beating brands,” he said. “I look forward to sharing this journey with the viewers as we mould some of Zimbabwe’s models, who you will possibly see in your magazines, television commercials, TV shows and films pretty soon.” Gilmore Tee said the reality show is important to the model and fashion industry which he says lacks exposure to the real competitive world. “Strut n Pose will bring the competitors face-to-face with some of the biggest designers, personalities and real life challenges, equipping them to be better models and aim higher,” he said. “I have the privilege of not only hosting the show, but also serving as an expert alongside, the incredible fashion designer Maita Marimo and top model Fisher Jordan.”
