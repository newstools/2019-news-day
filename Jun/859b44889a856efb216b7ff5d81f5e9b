Confederation of African Football president Ahmad Ahmad was being questioned by French authorities in Paris yesterday morning, world football’s governing body Fifa said. Ahmad, a former Malagasy Cabinet minister, had been reported last month to Fifa’s ethics committee for alleged corruption and sexual harassment by Caf general-secretary Amr Fahmy, who was then fired. Among the allegations are claims that Ahmad forced Caf to buy sportswear through a French company rather than directly from manufacturers and at inflated prices. “Fifa is unaware of the details surrounding this investigation and is therefore not in a position to make any comment on it specifically,” Fifa said in a statement. “Fifa is asking the French authorities for any information that might be relevant to investigations taking place within its Ethics Committee.”
