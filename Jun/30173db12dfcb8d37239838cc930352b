BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKA THE future of Warriors striker Nyasha Mushekwi and goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda in this African Cup of Nations tournament remains uncertain after sustaining injuries in the opening match against Egypt last week. Mushekwi was substituted nine minutes from full time after suffering a hamstring injury, while Sibanda sustained a knee contusion towards the end. A contusion is a situation where blood capillaries have been ruptured. Team doctor Soman Mudariki said the pair’s future remained uncertain. “Sibanda and Mushekwi sustained injuries in the opening match. Sibanda sustained a knee contusion,” he said. “He has been complaining of pain, but has been responding to the treatment we gave him. We will do a scan on the knee to ascertain the extent of the injury so that we give him appropriate treatment.” Mudariki said initially, there was a scare Sibanda could have suffered a ligament damage, but said the goalie had done well in the first 48 hours after the injury. “As for Mushekwi, he injured his left hamstring and complained of acute pain. We treat it as grade one hamstring injury. So far, he has been responding well and we are currently monitoring him and it will be decided whether we need to have him scanned. However, with grade one injury, there are good chances he will recover,” the Warriors team doctor said. Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambga has a number of options upfront, with Evans Rusike, Tino Kadewere, and Knox Mtizwa available, while George Chigova, who missed the opening match due to suspension, will be in goals tomorrow.
