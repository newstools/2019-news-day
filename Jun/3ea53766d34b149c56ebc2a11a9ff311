BY OWN CORRESPONDENT RENOWNED actor and Patsime Edutainment Trust director Jasen Mphepho is set to come back on stage this Thursday at the Little Theatre in Eastlea, Harare, with his one-man play A 1 000 Miles, after a year-long break from the stage. The play, produced in 2016 and showcased both at home and abroad, is centred on one man who narrates his different ordeals and life situations, reflecting on his past in the realm of the dead at his own funeral. Mphepho splits personalities and uses different voices in a stream of consciousness that begins when he sees his wife wailing at his funeral and protesting against the decision to have him buried at his rural home. “I have not staged this production in Zimbabwe for a while. My last performance was in May last year, when I did the same play during a festival hosted by Rooftop Promotions. I have not been performing much because no opportunities to perform were forthcoming. Being a full-time director of Patsime also took much of my time, as I am obliged to oversee a lot of things,” he told NewsDay Life & Style. “I have been staging it in Sweden, where I am part of a programme where I train people with regards to use of theatre and film as a communication tool. I have been performing it in Sweden for the past three years.” Mphepho said with the recent launch of the Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre, there was need for content for the theatre, which he said required him to come back to write, act and direct plays. The play will be staged from Thursday to Saturday. Entry fee is ZWL$10.
