BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA AFTER releasing her single with Kikky Badass, titled Married, local hip-hop artiste Precious “Phreshy” Herschneider Frank says she will be dropping an eight-track Extended Playlist (EP) —Muzambangwena — next month. Phreshy told NewsDay Life & Style that the EP would be her first big project since venturing into music five years ago. “I have been working on Muzambangwena for months now, and it is almost ready. The title is derived from a very special tree that always stands firm in any condition; be it good or bad weather,” she said. “Basing on what I have gone through in life, the good and the bad, I am just like the Muzambangwena tree because I have managed to stand strong. So, through this EP, I am telling a story of my life; the success, failures, love life, heartbreaks, dreams and everything.” Phreshy said her mother raised her single-handedly, making her include a track titled Sando (Momz) in her honour. “On the EP, there is a track which is a dedication to my mother and all the mothers out there, especially the single mothers,” she said. “The song talks about the struggles she went through raising me and my two brothers, and thanking her for all the love she gave us even though it was not easy.” Phreshy said she would also be dropping two videos from the EP, one from the track Ndinokakama, which features King Avry. The songstress said the EP was produced by VicEnlisted, Rayo Beats, Toga, Amvis, Afrow Zenda and features Natasha Muz, WaMambo, DaRuler, King Avry, Rap Operators and Jungle Kid.
