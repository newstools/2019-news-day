BY DEMETRIA MAYONGA UPCOMING afro-contemporary diva, Nancy Sibonginkhosi Mutize, known in music circles as Nasibo (pictured), is set to release a 16-track live recorded album titled Zaruwe. Nasibo said the album was inspired by her day-to-day experiences, including her love for culture and roots. “The album talks about  the challenges we face as people. Some of the songs on the album are entrenched in  tradition, which gives the album the realness of our Shona culture,” she told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday. The album, produced by Godfrey Mampondo at Music Crossroads Academy, has songs including Zaruwe, Moto, Hondo, Bereka Mwana and Amai Maria. Nasibo said her music journey had been tough, as there was little appreciation at home. “It’s been tough sometimes because it’s not easy when you are not really appreciated home, but getting a positive response outside Zimbabwe,” she said. The diva started her music career in 2009 as a back-up singer for various musicians, including Jah Prayzah, Edith weUtonga and the late Dumisani Ngulube. Nasibo has so far released three singles — Honaka, Zapeyi and Ngoma Yekwedu — since venturing out on her own in December last year. She also recently performed at the Marahaba Music Expo in Burundi. “I got to do a collaboration with one of the traditional female artistes in Burundi called Bernice the Bell,” Nasibo
said. “We did a song called Africa, where we talk about Africa and how we love our countries, the power of unity and how we can achieve more as one people.”
