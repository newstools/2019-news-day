BY FORTUNE MBELE The Bulawayo Metropolitan Karate Association (BMKA) will hold their second provincial tournament this year at Milton Junior School tomorrow. The major highlights of the competition will be in the senior section, where Branco Manyathela will fight it out with Julius Sigidi.
Manyathela’s style is the Japanese’ kimura Shukokai and is the national kata (detailed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs) champion who trains at Old Miltonians Sports Club. Sigidi is the Bulawayo province kumite (fighting) champion who trains under Sensei Sangweni in the Japan Karate Association (JKA) Shotokan
style at Bulawayo Bowling Club . BMKA chairman Sensei Ndabezinhle Mazibuko yesterday said tomorrow’s tournament is the third since his executive committee came into
power last year and their main thrust is to revive the sport in the City of Kings and Queens. “It is a tournament for juniors and seniors; the second that we are having this year after the first successful one which was held in
April. Essentially, as the new executive committee, our mission is to try to revive karate in Bulawayo because it had died over the
years. We are on a drive to revive the sport. It will be an individual kata and kumite competition featuring six styles. The tournament
will feature juniors as we have groomed a fair number of them,” Mazibuko said. Another karateka to watch is Tralise Mugwagwa, who does the Shito-ryu Kofukan under Sensei Mazibuko. The six karate styles that will be on display include the Kimura Shukokai, JKA Shotakan and its breakaway JKSA, Shito-ryu Kofukan, Karate
No-Mich and Sankunkai Dragon. In the juniors’ category, Anotida Bhuza, who has done exceptionally well nationally in the Under-10 age section as well as Ruvarashe
Makokowe are among those that will feature. Anesu Maphosa features in the boys’ junior section. Karate enthusiasts have to fork out ZWL$5 to watch the tournament at Milton Junior School Hall.
