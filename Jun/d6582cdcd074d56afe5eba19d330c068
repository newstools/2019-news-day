SOULFUL musician and prolific saxonist Joseph Tinotenda Chinouriri (pictured) — popularly known as Jose Saxo — is set to drop his first solo gospel album, Simple Impact, at the New Life Covenant Church in Harare on July 13. BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA Jose Saxo told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that the nine-track album was an offering to his fans and will introduce him to the market as a solo artiste. He said he took long working on the album, because he wanted to deliver a near-perfect product. “I believe simplicity has a great effect, as I would like to relate to everyone through my music, although I play a complicated instrument,” said the saxophonist. “The album was due two years ago, but we had to take our time to perfect it. Great work has been put by the Simple Impact team to make it happen.” Saxo said the album featured top gospel act Ellard Cherayi, music director Nigel Nyangombe and Naphtali Chivandikwa, the director of the song Victory, by Zimpraise. “The exclusive brass section is a brainchild of Joseph Chinouriri to promote horn and brass as I have noticed  that we have great talent with no platforms,” he said. Top gospel acts, including Sebastian Magacha, Michael Mahendere and Janet Manyowa, will perform at the launch, where Saxo will also do a tribute to the late music superstar and national hero, Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi. “At the launch, I will be doing the Tuku tribute as I worked with Dr Oliver Mtukudzi for a few years and he endorsed the projects before he passed on,” he said. The saxophonist ventured into professional music in 2012 and has worked with Tuku, Sipho Makhabane,  Sulumani Chimbetu, Jah Prayzah and Dudu Manhenga.
