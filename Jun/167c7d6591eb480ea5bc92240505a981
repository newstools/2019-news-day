Hwange…………………..0 AILING Premiership sides Hwange and Mushowani Stars celebrated a share of the spoils after their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League clash at Rufaro Stadium yesterday ended goalless. Hwange’s prospects in the league this term had shown a lot of promise at the start of the campaign with Nation Dube’s charges getting off to an explosive start and even overcoming Harare giants Dynamos. As an air of optimism swept across the mining town, things got awful trickier after their home defeat to Chapungu. Since then, they have never tasted victory, having suffered defeats in their last five matches, the celebrations that followed the referee’s final whistle were naturally expected. Assistant coach Edmore Sibanda did not hide his relief. “We played really well. The players played according to instructions and our game plan worked for us. We wanted to sit back and catch them on the counter.
Although we couldn’t score we got some chances in the first half, but we are really satisfied with the point considering that we have not won in the past five games and were under pressure to get a positive result,” Sibanda said. Mushowani also went into the match under pressure to deliver after they lost their last two matches to Bulawayo Chiefs and Triangle.  And assistant coach  Warren Mapanga was also elated to collect a point. “A point is okay for us given that we are coming from two defeats, even though we are not really satisfied. I thought we could have scored in the first half, but we could not capitalise on the chances we got,” he said. Mushowani remain second from the bottom with nine points, while Hwange also remained stuck in 13th position with 14 points after 12 rounds of matches.
