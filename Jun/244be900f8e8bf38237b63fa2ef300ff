BY JOEL TSVAKWI BULAWAYO-BASED upcoming jazz artiste Simbarashe Mtukudzi is set to drop a single titled Ndorangarira Tuku, which he said was a tribute to his late legendary uncle. Mtukudzi told NewsDay Life & Style that the single was a collaboration with afro-jazz ace Jeys Marabini. The musician said he was shattered by his uncle’s death and bemoaned the missed opportunities after he had planned to feature Tuku on his debut album, which he said was still in the
works. “We had been in talks with the old man and he had agreed  to fine-tune my work at Pakare Paye Studios because he also wanted to spice it with his voice and some Dande tunes. However,
that could not be realised as nature took its course,” he said.
“As a result, I decided to temporarily suspend my efforts to release the album by focusing on this tribute single, in remembrance of the legend.” Mtukudzi said he roped in Marabini because he was a seasoned afro-jazz artiste, which qualified him to feature on the album. Mtukudzi revealed that despite now staying in Bulawayo and having gone to Bulawayo Music Academy, just like his late uncle, he was largely influenced by his rural home of Dande,
Mashonaland Central, in most of his music.
