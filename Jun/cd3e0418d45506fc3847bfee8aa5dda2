By Munyaradzi Madzokere Top seed Takanyi Garanganga yesterday kept his dream of winning two titles in two weeks after he beat Indian Prajwal Dev, who retired after losing the first set 6-3, to progress to the singles quarterfinals of the Old Mutual ITF F2 Futures tournament currently underway at Harare Sports Club. In the doubles competition, the Lock brothers, Benjamin and Courtney, bounced back from a setdown to beat the pair of Briton Patrick Foley and Michael John Every from Curacao after a tie break and progress to the semi-finals. Favourites to win the title, the top Zimbabwean pair won the thrilling contest 3-6, 6-3, 10-8. Garanganga was champion at last week’s F1 event that concluded at the same venue on Sunday and is looking to complete a memorable two weeks at home with another triumph. After his conquest of Dev, Garanganga is scheduled to meet his victim in Sunday’s final, Canadian Martin Beran, who overcame fifth seed Simon Yitbarek from Sweden, in the quarterfinals today. On Sunday, Garanganga broke little sweat to beat Beran in straight sets. Compatriot Benjamin Lock, seeded second in the tournament, made light work of Michael John Every of Curacao to also progress to the last eight stage. Lock hit six aces on his way to a relative easy 6-3, 6-1 win and will now meet Iranian Hamid Reza Nadaf in the other quarter-final rubber this morning. Nadaf proved too powerful for Indain opponent Anurag Nenwani to win in straight sets 6-0, 6-2 and should be a tricky propostion for Lock.
In the other quarter-final match, Canadian Riaan du Toit will face third seed Lucas Catarina from Monaco, while Dhruv Sunish earned the right to play South African Charl Morgan.
