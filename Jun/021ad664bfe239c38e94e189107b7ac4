BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA The artiste, also known as Tinashe Zet, told NewsDay Life & Style he was ready to release his first offering, a 10-track album themed around seeking guidance from God. “I will be asking for spiritual guidance from God in a traditional and cultural way, so that he cleanses  my path  and bless my works,” he said. Produced by Lazzie Tee, Macelo, MT Zion got the Clique, Sanic Mugo and Sam Cris, the album has the tracks Mudzimundiringe, featuring Trevor Dongo and Terry Africa, Ziva Kwawakabva, Zimbabwe, Madhuve, Kwatinobva, Mukwasha Usangochema Nhamo, Pride and Joy and Panorira Ngoma. The Nyanga-based singer described the track Mukwasha as his best. “Mukwasha is my best track on the album which speaks about a man seeking a hand in marriage from a woman, but has no money to pay the bride price hence he is prepared to do anything to have the woman as his wife,” he said. Prolific guitarist Progress Chipfumo, who Tinashe Zet said has helped him a lot in his career, is also featured on the album. “I grew up listening to Progress Chipfumo and it made me sing what people are experiencing in their lives,” he said. Tinashe Zet joined the music industry in 2013 and has worked with a number of singers who include Accurate Jojo, an international artiste from Sierra Leone, on a track Gimmie Your Love. On the local scene, the musician has worked with Stunner on a track called Aindinyepera, and Terry Africa on Ndechedu.
