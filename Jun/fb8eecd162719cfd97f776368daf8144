BY FREEMAN MAKOPA TRENDING dancehall chanter Enzo Ishall released the video of his controversial song, Bhiza Rinoda Mutasvi, last night. Mutasvi is a Shona word which means horse rider or jockey and in street lingo, full-figure exquisite women are referred to as horses while Bhiza Rinoda Mutasvi literally means a horse that needs a rider. Chillspot Recordz’s DJ Fantan said they have developed a new approach in video making to meet international standards. “Bhiza Rinoda Mutasvi video is coming out Thursday night at 9pm to be specific, and this video has a new approach to video making in Zimdancehall. It has a western theme to it and it’s a definite must-watch,” he said. “Some of our fans think the song is controversial but it’s a good video and the song itself is trending so we can’t blame people for their interpretation,” he said. DJ Fantan said Bhiza Rinoda Mutasvi was a metaphor, which has many meanings and people were free to have their own interpretations. “Art cannot be put in a box so on this track, Bhiza Rinoda Mutasvi is a metaphor that can depict many meanings depending on the listener. In Zimdancehall, singing on a riddim is sometimes referred to as riding a riddim. One could conclude that but the song means a lot of different things to the listener if they
keep their mind open,” Fantan said.
