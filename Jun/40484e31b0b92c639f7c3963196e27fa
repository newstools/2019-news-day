CHICKEN Inn has snatched former Ngezi Platinum Stars midfielder Liberty Chakoroma to bolster their already strong-looking squad to confirm their dream to win this year’s Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title. BY SINDISO DUBE The lanky defensive hardman, who had been linked with a move to Dynamos since his unceremonious exit from Ngezi, signed a two-year contract with the Bulawayo-based club. Chicken Inn spokesperson Tavengwa Hara yesterday confirmed Chakoroma’s capture. “Yes, I can confirm that we have entered into a marriage with Liberty. We believe we have added an extra strength in the central defence department. The technical department wanted extra strength in defence after we failed to get our intended targets during off season,” he said. Chakoroma is joining as a free agent after his contract with Ngezi Platinum Stars was terminated last month. He was sacked together with Simba Nhivi for allegedly leading a players’ industrial action where they were demanding an upward review of their salaries and bonuses. Xolisani Moyo, who was fingered as one of the instigators of the revolt got away with a caution. Chicken Inn, who are home to some of the league’s best players at the moment, currently lead the log standings with 22 points, ahead of second-placed Caps United by a goal difference margin. The Gamecocks, as they are affectionately known, have publicly stated their desire to win the league title this season. Striker Clive Augusto is working hard to make that dream a reality, with his eleven goals in as many matches putting his side well on course of their second league title in four years. For his exploits in the last month including scoring a memorable hat-trick against Caps United, Augusto was this week rewarded with a May’s Player of the Month award while his coach Joey Antipas got the Coach of the Month award.
