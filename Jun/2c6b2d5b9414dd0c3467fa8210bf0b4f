ZimTrade chief executive Allan Majuru says he expects the trade policy and export strategy (TPES) document meant to boost exports to be ready before the end of the third quarter. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRA The TPES is an implementation framework document that is expected to guide government and the private sector on increasing Zimbabwe’s exports as it is the largest source of foreign currency. “Yes. Right now it (TPES) is getting input from the private sector, where it is making a lot of rounds so that we get full feedback from them. We are just waiting for their input. I want it to be out before the end of the third quarter, because it has to be very structured as the guys who do the business of exports have to really put their input,” Majuru told NewsDay. “It is sort of an implementation framework on a sector by sector basis of where we want to be and where we are now in terms of exports. It is just a simple strategy, which focuses on sectors for us to grow exports.” However, he said the figure which TPES would be targeting in terms of annual exports was still being discussed and waiting for input from the private sector. ZimTrade is the country’s trade development and promotion body. “I can decide to work with my simulations and put a figure, but what we want is also to be guided by capacity so that we own the goals together as the private sector and government,” Majuru said.
