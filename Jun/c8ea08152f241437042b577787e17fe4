By Freeman Makopa More than 2 000 athletes are expected to battle it out for glory when they participate in this year’s edition of Tanganda Half Marathon set for Mutare Sports Club this weekend. National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe president Tendai Tagara told NewsDaySport that the event would be used as qualifiers for the World Half Marathon to be held next year. “We are using the Tanganda Half Marathon as one of the qualifying events for the World Marathon to be held next  March, so we are expecting a turnout of more than 2 000 athletes. This year’s sponsors of Tanganda Half Marathon have decided to have their prizes in United States dollars, so it’s a boost to the athletes. We have also organised transport to ferry the
athletes from Harare to Mutare,” he said. Mutare also hosted the second leg of the JM Busha Marathon event earlier this year. Last year, Mr Pace runner Canisious Nyamutsika won the men’s Tanganda Half Marathon in a record time of one hour five minutes, also at Mutare Sports Club, with Misheck Sithole and
Munyaradzi Jere coming in second and third respectively. Caroline Mhandu won in the women’s category.
