Orlando Pirates have confirmed the sale of attacking midfielder Kuda Mahachi and striker Thamsanqa Gabuza to SuperSport United. The club did not reveal any details of the deals, except to wish the players well and thank SuperSport United for the smooth negotiations. “Orlando Pirates Football Club would like to thank SuperSport United for the professional manner that these negotiations were held,” a statement said. “The club would like to wish Gabuza and Mahachi the best of luck in their future endeavours.” It ends a difficult spell for Gabuza with The Buccaneers, which included him storming off the field in an Absa Premiership clash against Black Leopards last season, unhappy at the
heckling from sections of The Ghost. “I would like to thank the entire Orlando Pirates family for all they have done for me during my stay here; I leave here with a lot of wonderful memories and lifelong friendships,” Gabuza said. “I would like to also especially thank the chairman [Dr Irvin Khoza] for the father-figure role he has played in my life.” Gabuza scored 11 goals in 90 domestic Premier Soccer League appearances since his move from Lamontville Golden Arrows midway through the 2013/14 season. He did, however, play a more influential role in helping the side to the 2015 CAF Confederation Cup final. Mahachi spent just a single campaign with Pirates after also arriving from Golden Arrows, via Mamelodi Sundowns. He scored three goals in 15 domestic appearances. Supersport
