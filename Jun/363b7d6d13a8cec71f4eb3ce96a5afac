CELEBRATED gospel musician Tatenda Mahachi will share the stage with gospel legends,  including Rebecca Malope, at one of South Africa’s biggest music concerts, the AfriGospel Unite Festival in Durban tomorrow. BY ALBERT MASAKA This is not the first time that Mahachi has been invited to perform at the popular annual event, which has been on the cruise for the past five years, as he has twice graced the event, and in the process endeared himself with the fans there. “I will be going to South Africa to perform at the annual afro gospel music festival. This is another opportunity to represent my country and perform alongside gospel music giants,” he said. The top gospel acts also include Lebo Skgobela, Thina Zungu and Hlengiwe Mhlaba. “I performed at the festival in 2015 and 2016. The response from the fans has been awesome, hence the invite by the organisers again,” he said. Mahachi, who said he would perform live his latest offering, Victory outside Zimbabwe, promised his fans in South Africa an unforgettable music experience. The award-winning gospel musician and entrepreneur rose to fame in 2013 after releasing his third album, Agare, which featured Prudence Katomeni-Mbofana. He has worked with several artistes, including DJ Russo, Macdonald “Mac Dee” Chidavaenzi and the late multi-award winning South  African gospel musician, Sfiso Ncwane. His discography is made up of the albums Muyedzo (2007), Kure (2010), Agare (2013) and Rega Kumhanya (2015).
