BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE SUNGURA artiste Somandla “Mafia” Ndebele has lamented the devastating effects of piracy and aptly named his forthcoming album, Kurimira Hanga. Having recorded about 25 albums since 1999, the musician is now holding live shows at slow pace and taking his time in releasing albums, as piracy is feasting on his sweat. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style at Nzvimbo Growth Point, Chiweshe, over the weekend on the sidelines of Mazowe Central constituency legislator Sydney Chidamba’s victory celebrations,
Soma said the industry was no longer paying due to piracy. “It is so painful that we labour for our music, but someone on the streets just burns CDs and sells them on the streets. I have a five-track album coming between June and July called Kurimira Hanga. We are in serious trouble with piracy,” he said. “We are now conducting shows at a very slow pace, because in some instances we fail to get money and my boys will still need money from me so it is better to stay home and only go for shows when duty calls.” The musician shared the stage in Chiweshe with Sulumani Chimbetu, Simon Mutambi and Mvurwi-based artiste and comedian Lloyd “Matumbu” Jack.
