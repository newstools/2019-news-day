God has been kind enough to let me help tell stories that need to be told, and I thank the writers, producers, and directors who find my worth in extending their messages. I also appreciate the market for always being eager to receive my work,” she said. Mpofu-Sibanda is widely known for her role in yesteryear’s hit soapie Amakorokoza, where she played Tashi.
