Newly-elected MDC vice-president Lynette Karenyi-Kore has vowed to unite women in the party ahead of her planned outreach into the rural areas. BY Brenna Matendere Karenyi-Kore secured the post after a tightly-contested race that saw her battling it out with Midlands Senator Lillian Timveous and former Zanu PF women’s league boss Tracy Mutinhiri at the just-ended Gweru MDC congress.
In an interview with NewsDay, Karenyi-Kore said her first task would be to unite various camps of women in the party. “My contestants know the type of person that I am. I am saying, my first mission is to make sure that we put behind us whatever happened before the elections and come together to fight for change in the country,” she said. “Whatever was said against me during the campaigns, I am putting it behind me and calling upon all women of the party to unite so that we move ahead with the agenda of sending president Nelson Chamisa to State House.” Karenyi-Kore was subject to degrading insults at the venue of the congress with rivals accusing her of manipulating structures during her tenure as women’s assembly chairperson. Other party members also made jibes about her personal life. While other candidates for several posts such as the chairperson, deputy chairperson and the youths assembly chairperson came to the stage to congratulate their rivals who had won, Mutinhiri and Timveous were conspicuous by their absence when Karenyi-Kore was declared winner. Timveous, however, later posted on her Twitter account congratulating Karenyi-Kore. “I am the kind of a person that does not keep in mind insults no matter how dirty they might be. So my plan is now to work with the MDC women and go into the rural areas to canvass for votes and support for the party. “While in Parliament, we will also keep on pushing for laws that protect the rights of children and women. There has to be broad change in the political set-up as well as livelihoods for women and children,” Karenyi-Kore added.
