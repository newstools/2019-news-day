The SRC wants to oversee another forensic audit following another one that was concluded in November last year, whose results have not been made public. Zimbabwe’s supreme sports managing body on Friday stated that it had terminated its contract with the company that audited ZC accounts last year and would be hiring a new firm for a fresh audit. Yesterday ZC, through acting managing director, wrote to the SRC asking the government body to furnish them with the outcome of the previous audit. “In your letter dated July 27 2018 you advised Zimbabwe Cricket of the fact that you had commissioned BCA Consulting Services to conduct a forensic audit on
Zimbabwe Cricket for the financial year 2015-2017. ZC assisted the auditors and was cooperative in all aspects,” read part of Makoni’s letter to SRC director-
general Prince Mupazviriho. “Zimbabwe Cricket was advised that the audit would be carried out over a period of three months, however, in your letter dated November 21, 2018, you then
extended the period of the completion of the audit to end of November 2018. As of December 2018, Zimbabwe Cricket has anxiously been waiting a finding on the
forensic audit, but to date no audit report or any report on the findings has been furnished to Zimbabwe Cricket. To our surprise we read a Press statement
released by your office on June 13, 2019 stating that you terminated your agreement with BCA Forensic Audit Services and that a new auditor would be appointed
to audit Zimbabwe Cricket. It is our request that we be furnished with a report on the findings by BCA Forensic Audit Services before a new auditor is
appointed to audit Zimbabwe Cricket.” ZC and the SRC, whose board is led by prominent lawyer Gerald Mlotshwa,  have been squabbling since last week when the SRC tried to stop an elective annual
general meeting (AGM) called for by Mlotshwa at the weekend. The Tavengwa Mukuhlani-led ZC, went ahead with their AGM and the SRC has since demanded answers on why that meeting went ahead despite a prohibitive order. ZC argued that they followed procedure and they were obligated by the International Cricket Council to hold the meeting which needed to go through the
organisation’s financial books before presentation to the global body next month. Meanwhile, the Mashonaland Cricket board dealt a body blow to the SRC yesterday when they denied that they had any problems within their camp. One of the reasons why the SRC decided to suspend the elective AGM was that there had been a dispute over elections at the Harare Metropolitan Cricket
Association. The association wrote to Mupazviriho yesterday in a letter that read in part: “We are greatly astounded by the fact that  your letter states that your office received a complaint from our province regarding the nomination process. As Harare Metropolitan Cricket Association, we have never made any formal complaints
regarding the nomination process of the provincial election process in Harare. Elections were held in terms of our provincial and ZC constitutions and a board
was elected thereafter.” The ICC has since warned that the government’s interference could result in penalties that include suspension or withdrawal of certain rights, among them financial.
