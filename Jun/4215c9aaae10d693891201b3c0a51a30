The 10-track offering, which has two bonus tracks, was inspired by the songbird’s life experiences, she told NewsDay Weekender Life & Style. “The album is about the struggles I faced in life, the questions asked about my whole being, my sexuality, my love life and the things I see every day,” she
said. She acknowledged Lisa Promotions and Phat Phamily in South Africa for helping her to push her music since 2016 as she sought a foothold in the male-dominated
music genre. Covenant — as she is known in music circles — said she roped in a number of producers to give the new offering a cutting edge in the competitive, cut-throat
industry. K Jonz and Gullies from Zimbabwe are working together with South Africa’s Kevin and Ikon on the new production, which has the tracks Madii, Mudzepete, Nyoka Mugumbeze, Waenda and Mwana Rombe, among others. Covenant, who has a bone to chew with Chillspot Records, said the title track was dedicated to Chillspot Records concerning a ‘covenant’ they made to her but
which they are still to see through. “Chillspot signed me in 2018 but said they wanted to push another batch of artistes first before assisting me,” she said. “So the track is directed to Fantan, the producer, reminding him of the promise he made. I believe they can make me reach my dream.” Covenant started recording in 2016. She has a number of singles and also did a remix of Darula’s song titled Goodbye. She scooped the top award at the Clash Queen of Dancehall 2018 which saw her attracting the attention of Chillspot Records.
