BY STEPHEN CHADENGA NATIONAL Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) chairperson Justice Selo Nare yesterday launched the Midlands provincial peace committee to spearhead  peace-building initiatives in the province. The committee will be chaired by Musasa Project executive director and NPRC commissioner Netty Musanhu, while Zanu PF Midlands provincial spokesperson Cornelius Mpereri and provincial
police spokesperson Ethel Mukwende will serve as her deputy chairpersons. Other committee members are Florence Guzha, Titus Mangoma, Tawanda Sibanda and Victoria Koke. Speaking at the launch, Nare said he was confident that the committee would help maintain cordial relations in the province.
“This province is harmonious and people are going to work well to maintain the cordial relations enjoyed in this region,” Nare said. “Midlands is diverse, so there is need to include all groups of people in this peace building initiative. The provincial committee should also establish peace committees at district
level so that peace building cascades to and from the national, provincial, district and ward levels.” Nare said the committee should mediate in disputes when they arise in the province to prevent the recurrence of violence and conflict in the future. Musanhu said major issues the provincial committee would deal with include mining disputes, politicisation of mining activities, politicisation of social services as well as lack of tolerance among political parties and the underdevelopment of the province, given the amount of natural resources in the region. Musanhu said the committee would also deal with the contentious Gukurahundi issue, since parts of the Midlands province were also affected by the 1980s genocide.
