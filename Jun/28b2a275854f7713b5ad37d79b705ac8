BY RUVIMBO MUCHENJE ESKOM, South African electricity public utility, has denied the recent announcement by Information Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa that Zimbabwe had paid $10million of its $33million debt to the utility, saying by close of business on Friday 28 June 2019, they had not yet received the payment. Eskom released a statement on Twitter to this effect.  Mutsvangwa told journalists at a media briefing on Tuesday that Government had paid US$10 million to Eskom and paid off $20 million to Zesa Holdings to clear its debt. “Cabinet was advised by the Minister of Energy and Power Development that Treasury has now fully paid off government’s debt obligation to ZESA, which was around RTGS 20 million. A further RTGS 20 million is due to be advanced to ZESA by Treasury, in order to boost power generation by the utility. This, together with the payment of 10 million U.S. dollars to Eskom, should help alleviate the current power supply situation,” Mutsvangwa said. More to follow….
