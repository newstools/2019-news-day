BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA THE next edition of the monthly Gospel Soul Nights is set for July 5 and will be covered live on Facebook, the organisers have said. Spokesperson of the event, Penlope Makanaka Chinzou, yesterday said they were going to bring a different vibe to the show. “On our July 5 show, we are going to have a line-up that will bring a different vibe to the show. We shall have, for the first time, a solo bassist and again it’s going to be live on our Facebook page for the first time,” she said. Chinzou said there will be an interactive up-close and personal set-up which will allow the artiste to share their story, while audiences enjoy the music.
“There shall be an interactive  up-close  and personal set-up that allows  the artiste to share  their story while  the audience  can enjoy  each other’s company with  music and laughter  in a much more relaxed  manner, and  the host having  to interview  the artistes while performing too,” she said. The Gospel Soul Nights concept was founded by gospel musician Joel Chiweda (pictured) from New Life Covenant Church, who is also the show’s director. Founded in February 2017, the Gospel Soul Nights are held throughout the year, with distinctive themes for each show, and are characterised by theatrical performances, spoken word, dances, comedy and music acts at Jan Jam Men’s wear store in Harare. Jan Jam are among the show’s partners and clothes sponsors. Top gospel acts, including Pastor G, Janet Manyowa, Shammah Phiri and Kuda Rice have performed at previous editions. While Sharon Manyika, Josh Meck and Marbel Madondo, among others, are expected to grace the soul nights in future.
