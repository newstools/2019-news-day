BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA POPULAR local television movie series Tunga’s core writer, George Jonasi (pictured), says although he has made significant inroads in the arts industry, he was still challenging himself to do more. Jonasi told NewsDay Weekender Life & Style that he had a number of projects lined up for release before the end of the year. “I am planning my things underground  and I will make an explosion once and for all,” he said. “I will always challenge myself to go for big things  and I am promising a lot. This year, I will release a romantic comedy movie called Caught in Between, a romantic comedy which is to be launched in August, two singles, Ndega featuring  Tawonga, and Fake Pastor, featuring  Nokue Sweetness and a short film, Will
Never See You Again.” The multi-talented rapper, actor, and script writer — popularly known as Jay4real — has also featured in Tunga. The 24-year-old said the movie is centred on a pastor who has an extra-marital affair before hell breaks loose when the woman finds out she is being used. “The movie is about a prominent businessman and pastor who gives in to temptation and falls in love with another woman. Things get nasty when the woman realises she is being used to satisfy his lust and therefore seeks revenge by blackmailing the man of God,” he said. The movie was produced by United Kingdom-based Daniel Robson Ndlara. Besides the movie, Jonasi said the single, Ndega, produced by QuaZor from Young Games Entertainment will also be released this year as he focuses more on his music. The multi-talented creative has also written the Tete neMuroora drama series as well as the short film, Saka Wakuita Sei?
