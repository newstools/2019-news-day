BY WINSTONE ANTONIO EMERGING gospel songbird Tafadzwa Mukaro’s latest album — Vanondichengeta — could not have come with greater endorsement with a star-studded line up of Machanic Manyeruke, Michael Mahendere, Olinda Marowa and Bethen Pasinawako-Ngolomi set to grace the launch on Friday. The eight-track offering is the third in the musician’s discography after Mwari Anesu and Tomurumbidza. Mukaro told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that she was excited to be supported by seasoned artistes. “This is a great honour, to be supported by such big artistes at my third album launch, who are not only celebrated on the local scene, but also on the international front,” she said. “Having an engagement with such top artistes who have vast experience in the industry is a great opportunity for one to learn and grow a career.” Mukaro said her compositions were inspired by the word of God, to whom she said she was grateful for the gift of composing songs and the message impressed upon her heart. “I compose songs from inspiration and my personal experiences so, as a result, I share to strengthen and inspire others. It has been a great journey of self-discovery and growth, which I am thankful to God for,” she said. Tracks on the album are Vanondichengeta, Makata, Tibatei, Ndashanda, The Holy Spirit, Kupisirira Kunezuva, Ndigonesei Mwari and Faithful God. “The message contained in the album is about what real life struggles are. The songs on the album also communicate the hope that lies in God. We can do all things through Christ, who gives us strength,” she said. Mukaro worked with three producers on the album, a move she said gave the album a cutting edge.
