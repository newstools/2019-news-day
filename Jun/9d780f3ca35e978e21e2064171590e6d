Top Zimbabwe tennis player, Takanyi Garanganga was the last man standing after beating unseeded Canadian Martin Beran in straight sets to win the ITF Futures singles tournament at Harare Sports Club yesterday. BY MUNYARADZI MADZOKERE Garanganga needed 1 hour 23 minutes to end Beran’s memorable run in the tournament, winning 6 – 3, 6 – 4 in front of the home crowd. It was Garanganga’s first triumph since his win over compatriot Benjamin Lock, in the last of a series of three professional tournaments held in the country annually during winter at the same venue last year. The 706-ranked Canadian’s impressive run saw him beat fifth-seeded Swede Simon Yitbarek in the second round before upsetting one of the tournaments favourites, Lock, in a three-set last eight thriller. Beran accounted for fourth-seeded Guy Orly Iradukunda from Burundi in the penultimate round to progress to the final, where he eventually rolled over against the top seed. It was also Garanganga’s ninth singles win on the ITF circuit since 2012. The 458-ranked star will be among the favourites to win two ITF tournaments lined-up for Harare Sports Club in the next two weeks. The doubles contest went to the Indian pair of Prajawal Dev and Rishi Reddy, who beat Beran and his British partner Joshua Paris 7 – 6 6 – 4 on Saturday.
