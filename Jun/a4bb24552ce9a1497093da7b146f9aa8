BULAWAYO dancehall chanter Lassie Ndlovu said he hoped his recently-launched high-end clothing label — Fresh Juice — would become a competitive clothing brand in the country. BY CRAIG MOYO Popularly known as Problem Child in dancehall circles, Ndlovu started his music career in the early 2000s, while based in South Africa. The musician-cum-fashionista told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that the clothing brand should be competitive locally. “The designs of the clothing brands are impressive and the aim is to stay competitive in the market by bringing in new styles in the product as people always have a different fashion taste. Fresh Juice should appeal to our clients so that it becomes popularly known in the city and nationwide,” he said. Ndlovu said he has always had a passion for starting his own clothing label. “My love for fashion started when I was part of a dancing group called MaGauteng in 2000 in South Africa. I have kept the dream alive as I have started my clothing label, Fresh Juice, in which the label has T-shirts and tracksuits for both men and women,” he said. The clothing label was launched last month at The Vista club in Bulawayo and featured Bulawayo rappers POY and Mzoe 7. At the launch of the clothing label, Ndlovu also launched his single Sengikhona’s video.
