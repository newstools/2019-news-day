By Jotham Gutsa Econet Wireless came out tops as the best performing telecommunications company in Zimbabwe at an awards ceremony which honoured companies adapting smart technologies yesterday. The awards were part of a conference organised by Global Renaissance Investment (GRI) to discuss ways to harness technology for economic growth. Other winners on the day included CBZ, which was awarded the best smart technology bank. Zol won the best internet service provider (ISP) award, coming ahead of TelOne and Powertel. The adjudication criteria considered reliability of the service, its economic impact and brand visibility. GRI chief executive Ngoni Dzirutwe said it was imperative that the country adopts smart technology in order to grow the economy “Most banks have reported profitability in the past year, riding on smart technology. This is a testament that smart technology reduces costs and boosts profits for companies. “China and India, currently hubs of technology, are exporting more goods because technology has reduced the costs of production for their companies.” Dzirutwe added it was crucial for Zimbabwe to embrace technology in most facets of the economy so as to help it achieve its 2030 vision of becoming an upper-middle income nation. “The symposium also tried to bridge the gap between the academia and the private sector. Our university graduates need to be commercially equipped so that the nation becomes self-
sustainable in information communication technology (ICT) systems. “Currently, the country is losing a lot of forex to international ICT companies, yet we have a crop of young innovative graduates who need commercialisation techniques to enable them
compete with international companies,” he said.
