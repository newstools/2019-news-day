THE sprouting of peri-urban settlements in the Midlands capital is burdening the existing old infrastructure run by Gweru City Council, a senior council official has said. BY STEPHEN CHADENGA Town clerk Elizabeth Gwatipedza said the city was struggling to provide adequate water to residents and the rapid urban expansion was an extra load on the city’s ability to adequately provide water to all areas. “Right now, our water pumping capacity is 60 megalitres per day and if we are to add new residential developments, there is need to double that figure,” Gwatipedza said last week at a meeting where the Land Commission chaired by Justice Tendai Uchena was making inquiries into the sale of State land in and around the Midlands province dating back to 2005. “There is need for rural district councils surrounding the City of Gweru and land developers to work closely with us so that we can share the investment on the existing water and sewer infrastructure. We also need to share on refuse collection among other developments.” In 2017, Gwatipedza called on the local authority to adopt a strategic master plan to enable provision of water and sewer services to new residential areas. In recent years, the city has witnessed a sharp increase in the development of residential stands, with some stretching into peri-urban and rural areas. The worsening economic situation has seen the Midlands capital struggling to complete rehabilitation work on its water infrastructure.
