BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKA IN CAIRO, EGYPT EGYPTIAN football giants Al Ahly have reportedly revived their interest in Warriors forward Khama Billiat, who displayed a scintillating performance in the opening match of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) against hosts Egypt on Friday night. Zimbabwe lost 0-1 to the Pharaohs, but Khama’s individual brilliance caught the eye of several scouts with Al Ahly said to have made inquiries again. The Egyptian football giants are long-term admirers of the Zimbabwean forward who currently stars for Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa after dumping Mamelodi Sundowns. Warriors team manager Wellington Mupandare confirmed that Al Ahly have made inquiries on Billiat once more. “It seems they are determined to have him here. They have inquired about him, but there is nothing concrete yet. It is only inquiries,” Mupandare said. Billiat refused to speak to Zimbabwean journalists after the match against Egypt, preferring to speak to the South African media citing criticism back home. Al Ahly fans have also been begging him to stay behind after the tournament. The Kaizer Chiefs man, however, told the South African media that while he appreciated the Egyptians’ love for him, he had a contract with his current club which he had to respect. He also revealed that his focus at the moment was on the Afcon with the Warriors. “I appreciate the Egyptians’ love for me, but I have a contract which I have to respect. My focus right now is on the Afcon,” he said.  The Warriors star attracted the attention of Al Ahly when he was still on Mamelodi Sundowns books. As the Warriors prepare for a showdown against Uganda tonight, a lot is expected from Billiat who is famed for his dribbling skills. Zimbabwe desperately need a win against Uganda to enhance their chances of qualification into the round of 16.
