By Miriam Mangwaya THREE Chivhu men were on Thursday jailed for 12 months each for possessing  US$30 fake notes. Tafadzwa Mudzingwa (29), Pilani Moyo (24) and Edinos Jakwi (23)  pleaded guilty when they appeared before Chivhu magistrate Felix Chauromwe. Moyo told the court that he got the fake notes from South Africa. The State, led by prosecutor Thomas Mushangidze, told the court that on June 18, 2019, police received  a tip off that Mudzingwa and Moyo were in possession of counterfeit notes. Police searched the pair at their residence and recovered three US$10 notes and a R200 note. They later implicated Jakwi, leading to his arrest. The recovered notes were taken to CBZ Bank  in Chivhu, where certificates of counterfeit notes were issued.
