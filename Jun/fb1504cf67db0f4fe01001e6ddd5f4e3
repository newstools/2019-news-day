BY Kevin Mapasure Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambga is set to spring a surprise and set out an attacking formation when the Zimbabwe senior men’s national football team collide with Egypt in the opening match of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals at Cairo International Stadium tonight. Kickoff of the Group A clash is set for 10pm. The Warriors are to go out, sit back and wait for counter attacking opportunities, which is very much in keeping with Chidzambga’s style, but the wily coach is planning to take the
game to the highly-fancied Egyptians. Egyptian coach Javier Aguirre has already said that he expects no surprises from Zimbabwe whom he expects to sit back and try to rely on counter raids and set pieces, but It seems he may be in for a shock himself. Under Kalisto Pasuwa Zimbabwe employed a similar method at the last Afcon finals, particularly in their match against Algeria, which they went close to winning before Rihad Mahrez
intervened. Bar the Warriors die hards, many expect Egypt to coast to a routine victory, while there is a general belief that the Warriors will primarily target a share of the spoils. There is a different attitude in camp as the team firmly believe that they can collect all three points. Edmore Sibanda is set for the goalkeeping spot with George Chigova suspended, while Tendai Darikwa, Aleck Mudimu, Teenage Hadebe and Devine Lunga should take their places in the back
four. At the base of the midfield, Chidzambga will go with the duo of Marshall Munetsi and Marvellous Nakamba, while Ovidy Karuru, Khama Billiat, Knowledge Musona and Nyasha Mushekwi carry the attacking threat.
