By Henry Mhara Dynamos coach, Lloyd Chigowe feels let down by Archford Gutu, who seems reluctant to sign a contract with the team despite spending the greater part of the pre-season period training with the Harare football giants. Gutu was absent from training yesterday, having missed the team’s pre-season match at the weekend. It is understood the striker is not keen on a long-term contract with DeMbare and would rather sign a one-year deal. DeMbare are insisting on a contract of at least two years. The two parties have failed to reach common ground and it is increasingly looking most likely that he will opt to join another club. Chigowe was looking to rebuild the new-look DeMbare side around the experience of Gutu and club returnee Edward Sadomba. But his plans seem to be headed for a brickwall as the club administration and Gutu are failing to reach an understanding. Chigowe has resigned to losing the talented midfielder. “I feel that Archie has let us down big time. We had put faith in him to help blend with the youngsters and add experience, but this is a free country and a man has got to make his own decision about his future and his life,” Chigowe said yesterday. “I feel betrayed because he had assured us that he will be part of the team, but I have learnt to live with such kind of disappointments. We have got to move on. It’s like we say Archford Gutu has been injured for the whole season, so Dynamos cannot play.” In 2016, Gutu spent a bit of time training with Dynamos, but left to join bitter rivals Caps United, where he endured a difficult period, struggling to get game time under Lloyd Chitembwe. DeMbare lost a host of players to other teams and have had to start afresh as they look to bring back the glory days after struggling last season, spending the greater part of the season flirting with relegation.
