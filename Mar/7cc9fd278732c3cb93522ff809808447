BY WINSTONE ANTONIO GOSPEL artiste Mathias Mhere yesterday described his performances at embattled Shepherd Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering Church in South Africa on Monday as a great experience. The musician did not allow the legal woes besetting the cleric to affect his performance. Bushiri and his wife, Mary, are out on R100 000 bail each after they were charged with fraud, money laundering and contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, in relation to exchange control regulations allegedly involving USD $1,1 million. Mhere, who shared the stage with Swazie Dhlamini of Joyous Celebration Choir and Praise Peterson, however, did not let that dampen his show, as he was charmed by the invitation. “Being invited to perform at a church that commands such a (huge) following for the first time was a great honour that shows there are some people who recognise our work of ministering through music, even beyond the borders,” Mhere told NewsDay Life & Style. “The experience was really good… (and) we learnt a lot from those whom we shared the stage with.” Mhere said he was devoted to spreading the gospel throughout the world as well as evangelising through music. He is riding high with his seventh offering, Panogara Nyasha. Mhere has made a mark in several southern African countries, including Mozambique where he has a huge following.
