BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA LOCAL jazz crooner and guitarist Tariro neGitare has urged women to strike a balance between their work and their faith if they are to fully explore their potential in life. Speaking ahead of the International Women’s Day scheduled for Friday under the theme Balance for the Better, the songwriter said women needed God to realise their true potential and purpose. “A lot of women are lost because of a lack of identity, thus never realising their true potential and purpose, which can be fully achieved by having a relationship with your Creator,” she said. Tariro neGitare will headline this year’s commemorations during a breakfast event hosted by Rotaract Club at The Country Club in Newlands, Harare, where she will also be a panellist together with gender commissioner and former Women’s Affairs deputy minister Tsungi Hungwe-Chimbunde, South African Airways regional manager Winnie Muchanyuka and group head of retail marketing Alana Chinhara. The same evening, she will perform at a concert at Old Mutual Theatre at Alliance Francais alongside Amy and the Calamities and accapella trio Zinarayah, among others. There will also be special attendance by a female producer Deidre Prickisie. The songstress will also take time to sample tracks from her forthcoming album titled Exalt.
