BY TERRY MADYAUTA TELONE FC technical manager Joel Lupahla has demanded commitment from his charges as they kick-start their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League journey with a date against Herentals at Rufaro Stadium in Harare on Sunday. The Gweru-based side will be aiming for maximum points in their first trip to the capital. The Wifi Boys, as TelOne is affectionately known, have set a target of remaining in the Premier Soccer League. However, they will have to be at their best as their first five assignments with Herentals, Bulawayo Chiefs, ZPC Kariba, Yadah Stars and Dynamos are tricky. “I am expecting total commitment from everyone and for them to give their all for the badge of TelOne FC in the task ahead of us,” said Lupahla. “The coaches and the boys are ready, I can see it by their eagerness, but above all, we have to respect all our opponents in the Premier League.” Lupahla is anticipating tough times ahead of their maiden season, but believes his squad was mentally psyched for the work ahead. “It is going to be a difficult match for us because Herentals have been there. They know the expectations, but I believe we have a good side that is ready to fight. “We are venturing into the unknown and we have a number of rookies. So we don’t know how they will adapt to our first match, but I have told them that there is a thin line between Division One and the Premier Soccer League. For us, it’s all about what the boys want to achieve.”
