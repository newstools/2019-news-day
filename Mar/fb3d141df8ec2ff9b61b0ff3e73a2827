BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA MASHONALAND East police have launched an investigation into the death of a top Marondera wheelspinner, Edmore “DJ Ninja” Chikonzo, who died on Tuesday morning at his girlfriend’s lodgings in Cherutombo high-density suburb. Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Tendai Mwanza confirmed that investigations into the matter were going on. “The police are still investigating the case of sudden death that occurred at Cherutombo on Tuesday morning,” Mwanza said. According to a police report, Chikonzo was heard screaming at around 6.50am and when the landlady went to check, she found him writhing in pain and on the floor, with a cut on his chin. The landlady alerted her brother who rushed to find a vehicle to ferry him to hospital, but found him dead upon return. The matter was reported to police in Marondera who attended the scene and took his body to Marondera Provincial Hospital for post-mortem. The deceased’s final WhatsApp status has, however, raised suspicion that things may not have been well in his love life. It read: “Maybe I ain’t meant for nobody, my soulmate prolly a piece of chicken”. DJ Ninja was the resident DJ at The Legends Sports Bar owned by music promoter and businessman Daniel Masaiti.
