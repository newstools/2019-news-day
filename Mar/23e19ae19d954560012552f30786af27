BY FIDELITY MHLANGA Uganda Airlines is expected to soon join a host of other regional airlines flying into Harare. The airline, which recently acquired a fleet of planes, has put Harare on its radar of preferred destinations. In a post on microblogging website, Twitter, the airline said, “Zanzibar, Addis, Harare. We are almost ready.” The airline plans to ply the route with a Bombardier CRJ900. Other regional airlines already plying the Harare route include South African Airways, Ethiopian Airways, Kenyan Airways, RwandAir, Air Namibia and Air Tanzania. Air Botswana will resume flights next month after suspending the route two years ago. Air Botswana will be operating a 70-seater jet service, on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Another regional airline, Air Tanzania, also made a return to Harare last month after it stopped servicing the route two decades ago. Other airlines have, however, been suspending flights into Harare. Proflight Zambia suspended the Harare-Lusaka flights while RwandAir also discontinued bond currency ticketing services citing challenges in the repatriation of funds. Proflight Zambia said it was suspending the route effective January 29 because it was also failing to repatriate its funds.
