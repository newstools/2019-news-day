BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA ALPHA Media Holdings (AMH)’s Heart & Soul Radio on Thursday last week hosted South African social activist, Thato Molosankwe, who is on a 42 177km walk from Cape to Cairo, covering 49 African countries. The social activist began his journey last year in July on Mandela Day in Capetown and walked across all of South Africa’s nine provinces. He said he expected to reach Cairo, Egypt in 2028 as he seeks to raise awareness on gender-based violence and child abuse. Molosankwe featured on the H&S World’s Best Breakfast programme. He received a smart watch courtesy of mobile phone Company, Avion, as an encouragement to continue his journey across Africa. Molosankwe said he did not just want to walk, but his walk is also about educating men to change their behaviour towards women. “The abuse and rape and killing of women is getting out of hand so this walk is about regeneration,” he said. “I walk to different towns and contact organisations to give a spotlight to gender-based violence.” In addition to holding workshops to denounce violence, he hoped to encourage women to point out their abusers and urged them to file police reports whenever any violation occurred. Thato began his activism in 2014 after hearing about how rife domestic violence was within communities. AMH are publishers of NewsDay, Zimbabwe Independent and The Standard.
