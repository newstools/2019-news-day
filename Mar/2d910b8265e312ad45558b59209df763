BY SINDISO DUBE LOCAL artistes based across the Limpopo will be honoured at the inaugural Ezakithi Arts Awards at the Hillbrow Theatre in Johannesburg on May 4. One of the organisers, Angela Mageza of CC Media House, revealed that they would unveil the nominees soon. “We called for submissions and have so far received an amazing number, which has motivated us to come up with an event which will level up with the artistes and fans’ expectations. We have a total of categories, of which some will be honorary awards while some will be voted for by fans on voting lines, which will be made public on the day we announce the nominees,” she said. “The awards ceremony is meant to celebrate our own talent which is in South Africa. We feel like there are many artistes who are doing great, but are not fairly celebrated in their spaces. We want to reward and motivate them to do more. Back in Zimbabwe, there are many awards that reward local artistes, but the ones across the borders have no-one celebrating them, hence we came up with Ezakithi.” Zimbabwean splash musician, Khanyi, who is based in Johannesburg, said the awards would help motivate Zimbabwean artistes in Mzansi. “When I heard about the awards, I was happy and I wish I could get a nomination. We thank the organisers for coming up with such a noble idea. This will go a long way in empowering artistes. We have many Zimbabwean artistes who have since quit music due to lack of motivation, including the pressures that come with being a foreigner. But these awards will help motivate and give us a pat on the back,” she said.
