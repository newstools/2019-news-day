BY DUDUZILE NDLUKULWANI MATABELELAND Cultural Awards Trust will this year host an inaugural  two-day cultural expo themed Umthwentwe from May 25 to 26 in Bulawayo in a bid to revive and safeguard the region’s cultural traits. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, the trust’s chief executive officer Philani Ncube said they were inviting exhibitors and potential sponsors interested in joining the arts extravaganza. “This is going to be our first exhibition in our efforts to resuscitate the cultural practices of the region having noted that culture is being eroded due to the existence of different tribes. The non-awarding exhibition will target exhibitors from the region only,” he said. “We are inviting exhibitors to showcase their cultural products and these include traditional dishes, traditional dancers, those who can make traditional mats, cultural modelling and local languages authors among others.” Bulawayo is probably the only city in the country which has a complete tourism package, with its own cultures and heritage, eco-tourism, urban tourism, safari tourism as well as cruise tourism.
