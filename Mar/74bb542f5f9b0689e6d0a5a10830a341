On all these interviews I have made, it is clear that @tigonzi came into the studio and I played him the beat with other lyrics that were not even #Kure; some love song (sic),” he said. “He is the one that put me up… Speedy recovery to you, God be in charge and bring peace to your family. We need some #KURETOUR and it only makes sense you being around, big Bro. I pray that the law takes its course on those that are responsible (sic).” <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJt2fXm7K4E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> Although details were still sketchy by the time of going to print yesterday, it is believed that Gonzara was stabbed repeatedly. Many artistes and fans took to social media with messages of comfort and solidarity. “May God be with you star. Ndarwadziwa. You gonna be okay,” posted Terry Afrika. Music analyst Plot Mhako also weighed in: “Pray for Ti Gonzi. He was mugged and stabbed last night. #HipHop.” <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SD2v5OnNcLg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
