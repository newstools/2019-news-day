BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKA Caps United have lined up five friendly matches before the start of the 2019 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League campaign as coach Lloyd Chitembwe tries to manage his players against fatigue. Until last weekend’s clash against city rivals Dynamos, the Green Machine had not played any friendly match as Chitembwe was attending to some key aspects such as technical and tactical areas as well as general conditioning of the players. The Caps United coach, however, said after playing against Dynamos, he had lined up five practice matches as he seeks to manage fatigue. “We have about five matches lined up, mostly with Division One teams. We don’t want to play too many games because we don’t want to risk injuries and fatigue, so we really need to strike that balance in preparing,” he said. “We need to  do well this season and I believe with these five games, we should be at a level we want. We will be going to Chiredzi and Chimanimani, as well, where we are going to play some teams in Division One.” Caps United are set to play topflight newboys Mushowani Stars this weekend. “Obviously, it’s a process trying to work on the team and we saw its purpose. Sometimes training alone is not enough,” Chitembwe said. “I want to see the players in real action. We are trying to come up with co-ordination in the team. We are working on areas that we really want improvement and the game against Dynamos really served its purpose. I was happy.” Chitembwe was also excited with the return of striker Dominic Chungwa after a spell in South Africa. “I am happy to have him back, we still have two slots. He is doing well and is excited at training,’’ the Green Machine mentor said. Caps United have signed several new players who they believe can help in their bid to reclaim the championship they last won in 2016.
