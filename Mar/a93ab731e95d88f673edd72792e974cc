BY SHARON SIBINDI BULAWAYO songbird Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele took to social media to announce that she has embarked on a programme to shed off excess weight in preparation for the launch of her album and a whirlwind tour. Sandy also revealed that she would be doing this as part of a health check programme as she adopts a new lifestyle. “A weight loss journey has begun; watch the space, Woza 2019. Siyabangena #mummysgoals,” she said on her Facebook page. In a follow-up interview with NewsDay Weekender, Sandy said she easily gets tired so she needed to lose weight in preparation for her tour. “This body now easily gets tired and I am doing this for my health.  I am short and this shows I am obese. It is also good to exercise as one will look good and younger,” she said. “I am also in preparation for my album launch next year, for which I will embark on tours. I started exercising at the beginning of this year and I’ve lost 4kg and my target is to attain 67kg. I am on a weight loss diet and I have a trainer.” Ndebele said she feared her bums would become much heavier in old age. “Exercising will become my lifestyle and I will not give up on it. When I am now a granny, I fear my bums will have a bearing on me, as they will be heavier. I fear I may also suffer from back aches,” Sandy added.
