BY SINDISO DUBE CHARMAINE “Chacha” Chasweka may be a journalist by profession, but she believes she is called to music. After doing a song with dancehall chanter Dobba Donna —titled Who I Am —produced by Gabriel ‘Seku B’ Gwini, the Zimpapers reporter was nominated for the best print journalist award at last year’s Zim hip-hop awards. “My everyday experience in the newsroom, meeting artistes, inspired me to go for music, but that doesn’t mean that I will quit the notebook for the microphone. The two shall complement each other,” she said. Chacha said young people should be adventurous with life to discover what they want to be. “As much as I am a journalist, music is my first love and I feel like it’s my calling. I am still trying to find myself and to see what I can do. Lately I have been doing almost everything — dancehall, R n’ B and hip-hop; it’s been an amazing and exciting journey,” she said. The song encourages couples to love and complement each other for who they are. “I met Dobba Don at a studio. We exchanged contacts and we have been talking since then. One day he said he wanted to do a song and wanted me to be a part of it. For someone who is used to rapping, singing was new to me and it was fun. I also have been getting positive feedback from people,” she said.
