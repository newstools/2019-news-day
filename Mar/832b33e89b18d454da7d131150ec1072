BY TERRY MADYAUTA CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League newcomers, TelOne have appointed Jairos Tapera as their substantive coach, while moving Joel Lupahla, who helped the WiFi boys gain promotion into the topflight, to the post of technical manager. The Gweru-based side was forced to make changes to their technical team after the local football governing body, Zifa, insisted on the CAF A licence requirement for head coaches, a qualification which Lupahla does not hold. TelOne have finally aligned themselves to Zifa’s requirements by appointing Tapera, who is expected to work hand in glove with Lupahla who assembled the Gweru-based team. The club confirmed Tapera’s appointment yesterday. “TelOne Football Club is delighted to announce the appointment of Jairos Tapera as head coach,” the club announced in a statement. “He joins TelOne club with vast experience after having coached a number of Premier Soccer League clubs such as Black Rhinos, Hwange and FC Platinum. “He was also the head coach of the national Under-20 team which finished runners-up at the  Council of Southern Africa Football Associations Under-20 tournament in 2014. “In addition, he also coached Black Leopards of South Africa during the 2015-2016 season. “With his appointment, Joel Lupahla, who was the head coach last season, will assume the role of technical manager. “TelOne FC would like to congratulate Jairos Tapera on his appointment and wish him the best.” Following the condemnation of their home ground, Ascot Stadium, the WiFi boys will play their home games at Mandava Stadium in Zvishavane. They will get the ball rolling with a tricky away assignment to the capital where they will take on Herentals. After that, they will travel to Bulawayo where they face Bulawayo Chiefs before hosting ZPC Kariba, followed by an away trip to Yadah Stars and then a home date with Harare giants, Dynamos.
