NATIONAL Art Gallery of Zimbabwe (NAGZ) Manicaland director Elizabeth Muusha has appealed to government and Mutare City Council to avail land to artistes in the province to showcase their art works. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Muusha made the plea at a Mutasa South constituency feedback meeting that was attended by area legislator Regai Tsunga and Mutare council officials. “Artistes in the province are not able to freely realise their maximum potential as they were renting in various places for their work of business. They (artists) have no decent places to do their work, shunning potential business opportunity as they have been renting their spaces for 20 years,” she said. “Our artistes are being looked down upon by the government and various stakeholders. It is very unfortunate that we are still renting our premises 20 years down the line. We have tried to engage Mutare City Council so that they can avail land for us, but nothing has materialised, we are spending a lot of money paying rentals.”
Muusha said there are many artistes in the province who want to exhibit their products. “Just imagine in this rainy season they (artistes) are operating under harsh weather conditions despite the fact that we are attracting tourists around the continent and globe,” she said. Mutare councillor Simon Chabuka told the meeting that he was going to approach relevant authorities, including Mutare mayor Blessing Tandi, over the issue.
