Former Warriors goalkeeper Gift Muzadzi was yesterday sentenced to 70 days imprisonment after pleading guilty to failure to  pay $1 050 maintenance fees for his minor child as ordered by the court. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Muzadzi appeared before magistrate Obedience Matare, who suspended his sentence and ordered him to pay $700 on or before February 22 this year. The complainant is Muzadziâ€™s estranged wife, Angeline Makaita Muzadzi. The court heard that on September 29, 2015 and at Harare Civil Court, Muzadzi was ordered to pay $100 per month maintenance for the upkeep of his minor child with effect from the same month. Muzadzi, however, did not pay consistently, thereby accumulating arrears to the tune of $1 050 from June 30, 2017 to September 2018. The court heard that  Muzadzi only managed to pay $350 in the period. Linda Gadzikwa appeared for the State.
