EMERGING songstress and poet Patience Gumbo has released a new single titled Arise Beloved Zimbabwe, which is meant to strengthen and encourage Zimbabweans who have gone through unprecedented political and economic turmoil. BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA The song, which plumbs the depth of human emotions with its pathos, bemoans what has become of Zimbabwe, but expresses hope that the country will rise again from the ashes like a phoenix. Gumbo told NewsDay Life & Style that she had also written a poem with a similar title that deals with the same subject. “The challenges that have been faced in our nation, including the cholera pandemic, inspired me to write a poem with the same title,” she said. The jazz musician said she worked with a creative team made up of Mr Dafa X, Blessed “Blengoe” Ndhlovu, Mudikani “de Poet” Gondora and producer Tinashe Mutandwa. Gumbo said the song was off her forthcoming album and poetry collection: “It’s the first part of a forthcoming album and book of poems.” She said her fans were excited about the project in which she beautifully blended poetry and music. The songbird, who is married to Gerald Gumbo, said her husband was very supportive of her work. “With full support from my husband and cousin, who takes care of our two children, all things are possible and I am very grateful that I have someone who supports me in what I need to do,” she said. Gumbo released her first gospel song, Worthy of All My Praise in 2017 and since then, she had been learning the ropes in the arts and was happy that the future was promising. “I realise that I still have a lot to learn. However, the future is very promising as long as I remain unique and original. The sky is not the limit,” she said. Last year, she had collaborations with Brenda Moyo on her song titled Wedenga and also worked with Zimbabwe Female Gospel Artistes on the song, Vakunda VeZion as well as Blengoe on one of the latter’s poems.
