JIBILIKA Dance Trust founder and arts promoter Plot Mhako said he was fearing for his life after receiving threats from former Zimbabwe Big Brother housemate Hakeem Munyaradzi Mandaza over a Facebook post for an incident that happened at the Zim Hip-Hop Awards in Harare four years ago. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The latest dispute was torched by a video of the 2014 incident that Mhako shared recently on social media. Mhako and Hakeem have been involved in nasty public spats, as they exchanged harsh words in  a social media thread. Writing on his Facebook page, Mhako said he was shocked and outraged by Hakeem’s behaviour. “Former Zimbabwe Big Brother housemate Hakeem Mandaza has threatened violence against me over a Facebook post for an incident that happened in 2014 at the Zim Hip-Hop Awards where he dissed artist Pee Kay for what he termed an undeserved win”. The speech and altercation was captured by Africa Hip-Hop Blog and I just shared the video,” he said. In a follow-up interview with NewsDay Life & Style from his Germany base, Mhako said he was contemplating taking legal action against Hakeem upon his return home. “I am taking legal action. I will report him (Hakeem) to the police. I fear for my life upon return to Zimbabwe. He repeatedly threatened me with physical harm and thorough beating, even after the explanation,” he said.
