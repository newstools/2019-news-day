PSL Champions FC Platinum have acquired the services of Soccer star of the year finalist Godknows Murwira from Ngezi Platinum as well as Tatenda Perfect Chikwende from Bulawayo Chiefs on two-year contracts. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Having lost the duo of Winston Mhango and Rodwell Chinyengetere to Zambian side Kabwe Warriors and Boroka Stars in South Africa’s ABSA Premiership respectively, the platinum miners are looking to bolster their squad, with much of their focus on the Confederation of African Football (Caf) Champions League. The talented defender-cum-midfielder, Murwira, will be a good addition to the Norman Mapeza-coached side as they approach the group stage of the Champions League. The 25-year-old is no stranger to Zvishavane, having featured for FC Platinum’s cross-town rivals, Shabanie Mine, in 2014 before joining Harare giants Dynamos. Chikwende, on the other hand, charmed the platinum miners, having enjoyed fine form in Bulawayo Chiefs’ maiden season in the topflight. The 23-year-old playmaker was a vital cog as the Bulawayo side posted impressive results on the local front, accounting for the scalps of big names such as FC Platinum, Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders. FC Platinum media liaison officer Chido Chizondo confirmed Murwira and Chikwende’s coming on board. “We completed the signing of Godknows Murwira from Ngezi Platinum and Perfect Chikwende from Bulawayo Chiefs yesterday (Wednesday), with the  hope that they will add value to the team. We will also try to register them for the on-going Caf Champions League,” said Chizondo. The duo are FC Platinum’s latest acquisitions following the capture of forwards Lameck Nhamo from Triangle and Ransome Pavari from relegated Bulawayo City last year. The platinum miners have already resumed training as they prepare to host Orlando Pirates at Barbourfields in Bulawayo next week, Saturday, in their first group stage fixture.
