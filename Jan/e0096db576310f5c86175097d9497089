MUSICIAN-cum-comedian Madlela S’khobokhobo will this year officialise solemnise his 18-year old marriage to Soneni Moyo, NewsDay Life & Style has heard.
Speaking during his 39th birthday celebrations on Monday, Madlela said one needs to be a role model by doing the right things. BY SHARON SIBINDI “Today, it’s my birthday and I can reveal that I am 39 years old and soon I will be 40. This shows that I am no longer young,” he said. “A woman feels complete if she gets that special day (wedding) which makes her happy for the rest of her life.  If she is not married yet, she does not feel it.” The SamaMoe hitmaker said he had paid all the lobola he was charged and got married to his wife traditionally. “We have been together since 2001 and we had our first child in 2003. The child is now in Form Four at Cyrene High School. We have three children, two boys and a girl,” he said. Madlela also said he had taken heed of his fans who felt he had abandoned his main focus of story-telling through film and needed to go back to film making. He said he was now set for a full Madlela movie in South Africa this year. The musician-cum-comedian rose to fame in 2017 with his song SaMamoe, which received generous air play on all the country’s radio stations.
