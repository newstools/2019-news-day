The Changamire Festival Awards founder Jackson ‘Zimboy’ Muchechetere told NewsDay Life &Style that the increase in categories for this year’s edition indicates growth of hip-hop music in Zimbabwe. “The music industry is growing, so we too are growing as it grows. For that reason, we added 12 other categories to make them 30. When we started in 2016, there were 10 categories only and this growth has seen Changamire Festival Awards becoming the biggest hip-hop awards ceremony in the country,” he said.
