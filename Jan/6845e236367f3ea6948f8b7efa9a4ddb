AWARD-WINNING Bulawayo rappers Muse and Msizkay have come up with a rare collaboration on Asivumi, a song which chronicles the current economic meltdown, unemployment and self-hate amongst Zimbabweans. BY SINDISO DUBE The P2daoh-produced track tackles issues that affect the youths, such as the high rate of unemployment, economic meltdown and hyperinflation, including self-hate in one of the two songs that Muse will release this year. “Asivumi is inspired by events that we are all currently facing in the country as ordinary people. Times are tough and we are uncertain of what to expect. The song is also to motivate people to look deeper within them to make their dreams come true, no matter what circumstances they might be in,” Muse said. Muse said he was happy that he had finally managed to combine his voice with that of Msizkay. “I have always wanted to work with Msizkay for quite some time. We missed our chance to work together about two years ago. I find the way he describes stories that he tells in his songs amazing, and I felt his take and vernacular style would fit the project perfectly,” he said. The two artistes have been doing well on local radio stations SKYZ Metro FM, Khulumani FM, YA FM, Star FM and ZiFM Stereo. Muse won the best lyricist award during last year’s Glam Awards in Gweru. The duo was later separately nominated for the best hip-hop artistes at the SKYZ Metro FM music awards and the Bulawayo arts awards.
