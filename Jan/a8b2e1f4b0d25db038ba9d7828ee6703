STATE-RUN diamond firm, Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC), says it will carry out exploration work for gems in Marondera district as part of its expansion scheme. BY MISHMA CHAKANYUKA With alluvial diamonds fast running out in the Marange area, the company has been spreading out, with exploration work planned for Chimanimani, Kezi, Binga and Mwenezi. Early this month, State media reported that the company would invest $32 million in exploration projects to support a resource definition and expansion programme with output forecast to reach an ambitious 4,1 million carats by year end from 1,7 million carats produced in 2018. “Zimbabwe Consolidation Diamond Company intends to carry out mineral exploration in Chihota communal lands in Marondera district,” the notice reads. “According to the Environmental Management Act, this development requires that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) be carried out. As such, ZCDC contracted the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre to conduct an EIA study for the diamond exploration project”. ZCDC was established in 2016 after government kicked out firms mining in the Marange diamonds fields and nationalised their operations resulting in national diamond output falling to 961 000 carats. At its peak in 2012, Zimbabwe’s diamond sector produced 12 million carats.
