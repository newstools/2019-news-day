Kamativi Tailings Company says it will commence civil works at its plant site in Matabeleland North after the company concluded a $9,5 million offtake arrangement with a Swiss-based commodity trader, Transamine Trading SA. BY STAFF REPORTER In an update, the company said the agreement will not only secure the full project financing for a processing plant, but also secures offtake for the first 150  000 tonnes of +6% Li2O concentrate. “During Q1/2019, local Zimbabwean engineering firm, MEPP (Pvt) Ltd and the company will complete all aspects of the engineering DMS plant design criteria with MinMet, leading into the importation, erection and construction of the phase 1 DMS plant during Q2 and Q3/2019,” the report reads. “Also, during Q1/2019 the company will commence civil engineering requirements at the Kamativi site, which will include but not limited to the refurbishment of existing buildings, preparation of the plant site and associated buildings, reconditioning of the electrical, water and sewerage infrastructure required to support phase 1 of the project”. During the final quarter of 2018, the company completed bulk-test work on the tailing’s material, using South Africa’s national mineral research organisation, Mintek. The test-work was overseen by MinMet Projects Pty Ltd, a South African engineering firm company with extensive experience in lithium processing, having recently completed similar DMS plants in Australia. The results of the test-work met the company’s expectations with a sample of high quality +6% Li2O concentrate. “Green Resources Company, a locally registered environmental management organisation appointed by the company, is currently completing the environmental impact assessment and project approvals as determined by the Environmental Management Agency of Zimbabwe”. Kamativi Tailings Company is a joint venture between Jimbata, operating as Zimbabwe Lithium and Kamativi Tin Mines, a subsidiary of the Zimbabwe Mining Development Company.
