UPCOMING Bulawayo songbird Nomalanga Tshuma has defied the odds by venturing into the male-dominated pool of music producers and recorded a captivating gospel album — Your Grace. BY SHARON SIBINDI Tshuma (25), who single-handedly recorded her debut eight-track album, which she launched at Bulawayo Theatre, shared her experiences with NewsDay Life & Style. “I managed to push my music alone, following the death of my parents when I was 18. I have always had a passion for singing, but it was the death of my parents which triggered me to consider recording an album,” she said. “Before that, I felt like the world had collapsed on me as I was not strong enough to mourn through crying. Drowning my sorrows in music was the best and one of my songs, Ungowami, recounts what I went through during and after the bereavement.” She said the song speaks of the time when she lost her parents and had to turn to God. “No one was there for me except God. He was there for me, and he was the only one who knew what I was going through and as such, he brought me up,” she said. Some of the tracks on the album include Hallelujah, Ungisebenzele, God of Favour, Inyasha, Testimony, Uphakeme and Ingwenyama. The gospel diva said she was inspired by a popular Nigerian gospel musician, Frank Edwards and the duo of South African gospel giants Setshaba Pali and Debora Fraser. She said plans were afoot to market her maiden album before working on the second project. “However, I am working on my DVD for the album, I have just commenced the shooting and I hope to release it before the end of this year,” she said.
