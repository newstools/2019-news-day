AFRO-POP singer and dancer Mzoe 7 has poured out his feelings for radio personality KVG — real name Kudzai Violet Gwara — in a new song titled Same WhatsApp Group. BY SINDISO DUBE The Afro dance music video, which was directed by Ras Kaitse, sees the singer exhibiting well-choreographed dance moves as he opens up on his “crush” over “sexy” KVG. “In the song, I was celebrating our beautiful African women by expressing my appreciation for KVG. Not only is she beautiful and sexy. Her hustle, work ethic, confidence and commitment excites me,” Mzoe 7 told NewsDay Life & Style. “I’m into selfless and down-to-earth women like KVG because I, myself, am a down to earth and chilled person.” The award-winning Star FM presenter was last year reported to be in a studio romance with co-presenter Pathisani Sibanda, something both parties dismissed. Besides his affection for KVG, Mzoe 7 further explained the meaning of the song. “It’s also about being in the same circle or group with dreamers; people who challenge you to do better in life. It’s also about doing away with those who are negative about life, just as we are WhatsApp group administrators — we are also in charge of things like the flow of content in social media circles,” said Mzoe 7. Mzoe 7 also called out Cal_Vin, Mai Titi, Ginimbi and ExQ in the song. The instrumental was made by Murphy Cubic. Cal_Vin mixed and mastered the song and Ra Kaiste films. The singer is lined up for a show with dancehall chanter Freeman on February 2 at Zansibar Hostess in Bulawayo and also in Plumtree at Club Euphoria on Valentine’s Day. “I finished the year in good spirits last year with a number of shows alongside Jah Signal, Killer T and other artistes. And this year I have maintained the same energy and I hope I will continue doing well.”
