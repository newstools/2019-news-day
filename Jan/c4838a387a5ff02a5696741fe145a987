SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean music outfit, Abafana BakaMzilikazi has incorporated splash music into their genre as a way to widen their audience and market base, both locally and across the Limpopo. The group released a 12-track album titled Remember Me, which has tracks Mina Nawe and Iscefe, featuring Madlela, Amaphutha and Kheth’ Omthandayo that have become club bangers in South Africa. BY SHARON SIBINDI The group’s founder and lead singer, Doit Nkomo, said he was motivated to give their fans a full album “brewed” in South Africa after the release of their well-received single. “The reaction from my fans forced me to do a full splash album and back home (Bulawayo), a lot of people were raised by splash music so I then decided this time we create our fan base under the Doit Nkomo taste and banner,” he said. Nkomo said while in Maskandi music, they sang a lot of music about war, he has, however, decided on something different. “I am a cultural person and in Maskandi music, we sing along music based on fighting, people at war and warriors, but this time it will be different as splash music is all about love, dance and (other) many good things,” he said. “Singing splash music does not mean I have left the Abafana BakaMzilikazi stable, it is a way of creating and marketing myself. I enjoy Maskandi and express myself more.”The South African-based artiste said plans were afoot to release more albums and was looking forward to coming back home in April to stage shows and market his music.
