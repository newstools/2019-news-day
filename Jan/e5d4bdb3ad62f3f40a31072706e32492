JAZZ crooner and Green Ambassador Dereck Mpofu is back in the studio and currently working on his fifth 11-track album scheduled for release in March. BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA Mpofu has promised his fans some good love-themed tunes alongside strong social commentary. “My fans love the originality in my music and my producer Mono Mukundu is helping me to produce the best album. On this album, I have featured an international artiste, Wiyaala from Ghana, and local female artistes Fellistas “Mai Titi” Murata Edwards, Rachel J and Mr Lorraine, who is based in the United Kingdom,” he said. The Chisikana Changu Zimbabwe hitmaker said he usually released his albums during the beginning of the year as doing so  created opportunities for partnerships. “Releasing an album during the early months of the year gives opportunities to those who want to partner me as the year begins,” he said. Mpofu also included a song  which speaks to zero tolerance on littering, and has been influenced by the clean-up campaign initiated by President Emmerson Mnangagwa last year. The musician said although being a Green Ambassador was a big responsibility he is, however, grateful that he makes efforts to strike a balance between his musical career and ambassadorial role. His previous albums also include Handizirini,  Dr Philosophy,  Diplomatic Alliances and Godobori (Expert).
