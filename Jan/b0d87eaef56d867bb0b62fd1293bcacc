On approaching a curve at the 44km peg along the said road, the driver of the Toyota Hiace tried to overtake in front of the oncoming Honda Fit, resulting in a head-on collision,” she said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) is urging schools that do not own buses to hire roadworthy vehicles to avoid road deaths as pupils return to schools. “Many students will be travelling to boarding schools as schools open. Some schools have their own buses, while others do not. We are encouraging boarding schools that do not own buses to hire roadworthy buses that have passenger liability cover,” PAZ said in a statement. “We are calling upon all boarding and day schools to insure their buses. Passenger liability cover is a necessity. In the event of an accident, students and staff will be assured of compensation. According to our observation, there are many school buses that do not have passenger liability cover.”
