By XOLISANI NCUBE Harare City Council has resolved to splash $1,4 million for the design of a new stadium in Budiriro, to be named High Glen. Minutes from the finance committee tabled at the recent council meeting indicate that council will spend $1,4 million on the designs of a 45 000-seater stadium, whose construction was envisaged to start next year. The stadium was part of the city’s infrastructure development programme and part of council’s responsibility to provide recreational facilities to its residents’. “It is resolved that the sum of $1,4 million, being part of the pool of reserved funds provided for in the 2019 capital budget under the department of housing and community services, be released to facilitate preliminary works of the designing and drawing of plans for construction of High Glen Stadium,” part of the minutes read. At the moment, Harare has five stadiums, among them Rufaro, Gwanzura and Dzivarasekwa. Meanwhile, the ouncil has tasked its town clerk Hosiah Chisango to engage the Zimbabwe National Road Administration for a partnership to enforce payment of parking fees to those who do not do so in the capital. The envisaged deal will see motorists who park in Harare and do not pay being forced to do so when they renew their licences. Harare has more than one million vehicles and expects to collect more from its parking services, but is hamstrung by lack of enforcement.
