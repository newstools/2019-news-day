BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO AFRO-JAZZ band Ancient Tribes, led by Maizon Tazvitya, is set to host a two-hour fundraising concert, dubbed Something Musical, on Friday at Joina City to raise funds for its No to Girl Child Abuse campaign that will target Harare’s peri-urban settlements. Tazvitya told NewsDay Life & Style that funds from the concert to take place at Gotcha Nyama Restaurant would support campaigns against the abuse of young girls in Hopely, Dzivarasekwa Extension, Hatclif Extension, Caledonia and Epworth. “The concert is meant to raise funds for the girl child-rights awareness campaign set to take place in peri-urban settlements. The intention is to instil the idea of child protection as well as instil an awareness on the effects of child abuse among societies. Working with the Ministry of Health and Department of Social Welfare, we will start with Hopely,” he said. “Our songs are derived from a sense of dignity and social awareness, confronting effects of poverty, depression and the rights of ordinary people. Zimbabwe being a signatory to the Convention on the Children’s Rights, we saw it necessary as a group to champion chid protection.” Tazvitya said young girls in peri-urban areas were susceptible to sexual abuse, child prostitution and teenage pregnancies, adding that  as musicians they had a role to play in efforts to curb those vices. “The idea is to encourage our young girls to stay in school while we say no to sexual abuse. This will be a second phase. We did the first one last month in Hopely during the African Child commemorations day,” he said. Artistes lined up to perform at the concert included Progress Chipfumo, Eunice Magumbo and DJ Knife.
