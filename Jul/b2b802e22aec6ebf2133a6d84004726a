PRETORIA — Kaizer Chiefs talisman Khama Billiat (pictured) is not for sale, according to head coach Ernst Middendorp. The German-born tactician has warned interested parties not to bother making an offer for the Zimbabwe star.
Billiat has reportedly attracted interest from abroad as well as a potential return to Mamelodi Sundowns, prompting Middendorp to respond to the speculation. “We are in front of a season, we have put a lot of thinking and strategies in place and at this time there is no way to move into a direction of saying, Khama
Billiat can go because the money is coming in,” Middendorp was quoted as saying by Daily Sun. “No! And that’s very clear!” Middendorp added. Following a dismal 2018/19 season where Chiefs missed out a top-eight finish, Amakhosi have been determined to bounce back ahead of the new season and have
already made a number of new signings which includes attackers Lazarous Kambole and Samir Nurkovic. However, Middendorp suggests a departure for one of the club’s most influential players is almost certainly not on the cards. “I was never approached with any offer or whatever. And there’s no way to give the go-ahead to the technical team at the moment to release players like Khama
Billiat or other players,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Chiefs are busy preparing for their Soweto Derby clash in the Carling Black Label Cup on Saturday. Billiat has been named in Chiefs starting XI and Middendorp will hope the striker hits the ground running before Chiefs get their league season underway on
August 4. The Glamour Boys are set to open their 2019/20 PSL account with a match against Highlands Park. Goal
