BY BBC In Ethiopia, the wife of the man the authorities say masterminded a failed coup in Amhara state has been arrested, his daughter Mahalet Asamnew has told BBC Amharic. Brig Gen Asaminew Tsige was accused of being behind the killings of the state governor and two others on 22 June. Two days later he was killed as he attempted to escape from his hideout in Amhara’s main city, Bahir Dar, police said. Brig Gen Asaminew’s daughter told the BBC that police had raided their home in the capital, Addis Ababa, last week and taken away a car, laptop and other documents. Then on Thursday, they arrested her mother, Desta Asefa. It is not clear why she was detained. The police would not comment on the reported arrest. Last week, the authorities said that more than 250 people had been arrested, suspected of being involved in the 22 June violence. Along with the officials killed in Bahir Dar, army chief Gen Seare Mekonnen, and another general were killed in Addis Ababa.
