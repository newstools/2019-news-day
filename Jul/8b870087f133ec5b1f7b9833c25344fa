By Sindiso Dube Ngezi Platinum Stars gaffer Erol Akbay is confident that his side will defeat Highlanders as the Castle Lager Premier Soccer league returns with the match between the two ambitious sides at Baobab Stadium on Saturday. Highlanders will be under new management following the departure of coach Madinda Ndlovu, who has joined Botswana’s Gaborone United. His assistant Mandla Mpofu has been elevated to the hot seat, while former captain Bekithemba Ndlovu will be his assistant. Tembo Chuma remains the goalkeepers’ coach, while Brian Keti and Vezigama Dlodlo complete the technical team as fitness trainer and welfare manager, respectively. Akbay, who has seen his side go unbeaten in their last five matches, wants to continue on that run. “We are preparing very well for this encounter. We are playing a big club and we understand Highlanders will be looking forward to maintaining their fine run after beating Dynamos,
but we promise the best at our backyard. It will be a beautiful and exciting game of football which we look forward to winning,” Akbay said. The Dutchman added that he would beef up his squad during the mid-season window period to add fire power upfront as he targets winning the league title despite trailing log leaders FC Platinum by seven points after 12 matches. “Our motive is to win the league title and we will use the mid-season window period to beef up the squad. We are already in talks with some players, but I won’t say their names now
because it is too early and might jeopardise the talks,” he said. The former Highlanders coach revealed that all his players were available for selection for the Saturday match, except for the injured Kelvin Bulaji.
