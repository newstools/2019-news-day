JOHANNESBURG — South Africa’s Eskom group treasurer, Andre Pillay, will leave the power utility at the end of August, it was announced yesterday. This is the latest high-profile exit after its chief executive quit earlier this year. Eskom supplies more than 90% of South Africa’s electricity, but has implemented severe power cuts this year and is failing to generate sufficient profit. It is hinging its recovery hopes on a 230 billion rand (US$16 billion) bailout pledged by government in February. Reuters
