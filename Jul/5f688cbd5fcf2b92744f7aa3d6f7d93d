BY TERRY MADYAUTA Chapungu United are chasing former Caps United and FC Platinum forward Brian Muzondiwa as the Gweru-based Air Force of Zimbabwe side look to strengthen during the mid-season transfer window. Muzondiwa spent last season at Caps United, but was shipped out of the Harare giant’s dressing room after failing to make an impact. His manager Gibson Mahachi told NewsDay Sport yesterday that a deal between the two parties was imminent. “Yes, I can confirm that he has been training with Chapungu for a short while now because they have shown interest in acquiring his services and a deal is imminent during this mid-
season transfer window,” Mahachi said. Muzondiwa could become Chapungu’s first mid-season signing, while long-term injury victim Bastos Chihowa is expected to return. Chapungu return from the two-week league break with high hopes of reviving their fortunes after failing to win any of their last five league matches, with two defeats and three draws. They lost their last match to Yadah Stars, and would be gunning for maximum points when they confront Dynamos at Rufaro Sadium at the weekend. Chapungu sit fifth on the league table with 19 points, five points adrift of log leaders FC Platinum.
