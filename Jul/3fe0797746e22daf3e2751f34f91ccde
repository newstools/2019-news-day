BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Crystal Rich from Danger zone,who has been silent for almost a year now, is set to release his sixth album titled Top Secret on Monday next week. Crystal Rich said the album is about day-to-day life experiences and relationships will be released first on radio stations before taking it to Tendai Hall in Bindura for the official launch. “l love to sing more about relationships as it is a thing  which most of us are involved in. Everyone has a relationship, and l find it interesting  talking about them,” he said. The album, which was produced by Oskid, Mount Zion, Cymplex No limits and CashLibs features  top  Hip hop artiste Ti Gonzi, carries tracks including Ndakarohwa
Part 2,  Mhoro Doro,  Hwezhira,  Zhawakandida and Landlord. “On this album, l feature Ti Gonzi   on a song called Only You and it’s a love song which is about people who despise a relationship, but the promise made
between the two makes the relationship go even stronger,” he said. “Ti Gonzi is someone who is working extra hard and has been doing well lately in his career, and l believe he is the best person to work with and since he is
of a different genre, the fusion between Zimdancehall and hip-hop will attract more fans.” The 25-year-old musician has been away from the public limelight, running a family business. The chanter is popular for his songs Ndakarohwa and Usandisiye.
