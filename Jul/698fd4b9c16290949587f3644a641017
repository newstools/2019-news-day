South Africa’s Daimler trucks says it sees great potential in the Zimbabwean market despite the country’s apparent economic challenges. By Staff reporter Zimbabwe is experiencing a crippling shortage of foreign currency, spiking inflation and rolling power cuts, which have destabilised the country’s industry and the commercial vehicle market already constrained by limited financing options, and a repressive taxing regime. “It is a tough market, but that’s always the best time to push metal and look after your market share because eventually the market will turn, “ said Daimler head of export, Dirk Myer. “The resilience of the Zimbabwean market always shines through the region. The greater region is under pressure, but I must say Mozambique is beginning to turn the corner because of its oil and gas. From where we stand we see them as the next big destination for our exports,” he said while speaking at an event in Harare where the company’s local dealership, Zimoco, was awarded the best dealer in the region for 2018. Zimoco sold the most Mercedes trucks in a region comprising dealers from Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. It also had the most sales of the Mitsubishi made Fuso trucks. The Harare dealership was the top performer in a division called Select Trucks which considers sales of used trucks.
