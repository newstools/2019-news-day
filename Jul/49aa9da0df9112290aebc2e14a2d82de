Nyanhete said he felt honoured to be one of the artistes selected to travel to the UK for a show organised by UK-based promoter, Kaycee, describing the development as “a game changer” in his profession. “I am so humbled for the selection. It speaks volumes on how people out there are appreciating my work. I have been touring different countries across Africa and now this is my first one overseas,” Nyanhete said. During the tour, Nyanhete will also have a meeting with his UK-based personal manager Nigel Rubwe, where they would discuss the addition of a new strategic local player to the management team. Nyanhete is into electronic dance music and has released one album, Finally Famous and several other remixes. He has previously performed alongside popular African artistes such as Oskido, Turbulence and Mafikizolo. Late last year, Nyanhete was tipped by an international promoter for an international tour and this has come to fruition. Other Zimbabwean artistes he will perform alongside include young Garry Tight, T Gonzi and Lamont Chitepo. The youthful DJ said he was currently working on his latest offering titled The Hybrid and promised to perform it for the first time to his UK fans. “At the moment, I am working on my new performance called The Hybrid and I won’t disclose much because it is a surprise for my United Kingdom fans,” Nyanhete said.
