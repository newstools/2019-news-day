BY SINDISO DUBE AFTER doing well in featured tracks with Sandra Ndebele, afro-pop and house musician Leroy “Leeknotic” Mhike has gone back to focus on his own projects with the release of a single accompanied with well-choreographed visuals dubbed My Babe. The video, directed by award-winning videographer Andy Cutta, was released on Tuesday morning on YouTube. Leeknotic featured on Sandra Ndebele’s Tshibilika and Bayeke which were both directed by Andy Cutta. The afro-pop track which features Amvis is off Leeknotic’s upcoming five tracks EP which he is yet to name. “The song is a journey both into my life and relationships and also into my musical prowess as I prepare for the release of my EP, which I am yet to name, but I can confirm that it’s
almost done,” he said. My EP is based on my life and what I have gone through in my relationships. I am sure from what I have been through, other people can relate to in their lifetimes. It also carries tracks themed on love, life and relationships.” After working with Andy Cutta in previous music videos, Leeknotic said the duo has chemistry when it comes to work. “I enjoy working with Andy Cutta, he knows what he does, and he knows how to do videos and also how to make someone a superstar in the motion images. I have worked with Andy in my
previous videos and also in Sandra Ndebele’s videos so we have chemistry for working together,” he said. Born in Harare, Leeknotic had a stint in Botswana and South Africa before coming back to Bulawayo where he rose to fame under Afro Platinum Music where he released Gqom and house music, before relocating to Harare.
