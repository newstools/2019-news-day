BY CALVIN MAHACHI THE 2019 edition of the Lake July Festival hangs in a balance after organisers yesterday said there was a possibility the event would not be held this year due to the country’s crippling economic gridlock. The fiesta’s corporate site manager, Stanlous Mubaira, told NewsDay Life & Style that although they were trying their best to have the music and braai fete this year, they were not yet certain. “It saddens me and the entire Lake July core team that we cannot give our loyal attendees a definite answer for this year,” he said. “Zimbabwe’s largest festival is facing funding issues because the team has not managed to garner enough funds to go ahead with the festival due to erratic changes in the economy.” Mubaira said the majority of their corporate partners have indicated they were not able to fulfil their pledges this year. “Lake July is a corporate-funded event, but most of our partners are unable to meet their pledges and commitment to this project and without their support, it’s nearly impossible to host the event,” he said. He, however, said they were still working hard to see how best they can stage the fiesta to satisfy the demands of their loyal fans. “We believe with one or two corporates willing to partner with us and honour their pledges, we just might give our fans, exhibitors and artistes the platform they have been begging us for,” he said.
