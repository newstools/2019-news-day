BY WINSTONE ANTONIO DANCEHALL musician Emegy Sylvester Chizanga, popularly known as Freeman in music circles, yesterday said he will remain a “clean lyric” artiste, with songs laden with positive messages to maintain his brand. Freeman made the sentiments while addressing the media ahead of his much-awaited Gango album launch, in partnership with Nash Paints and Werras Entertainment, set for August 24 at Old Hararians in Harare. “I am of clean lyrics, which is different from some artistes who also have their own way of pushing their music. I don’t seek attention through explicit lyrics. That is not the Freeman-type of music,” he said. Freeman said the 10-track album features seasoned and upcoming artistes, with a combination of producers — Cymplex Music Records, TK Swiz, Mount Zion Records,
JMP, Jeepaz and Sunshine — to avoid monotony. “I have tried my best to deliver something which is good for the fans on this album. I always work with different producers on my albums,” he said. “I have featured a lot of artistes – unexpected artistes – that is why the album is called Gango. It has a mixture of genres and content as well.” According to sources in the HKD camp, the artiste also roped in sungura maestro Alick Macheso. Freeman said there are two videos off the album that will be released soon for the fans — as appetisers — ahead of the launch. Nash Paints’ sales and marketing manager Susan Bolt said they will be promoting Freeman’s concert, both locally and internationally, as they were committed to
supporting the arts sector. A series of road shows organised by Werras Entertainment, who have also partnered with Freeman for the launch, will be held ahead of the launch. Freeman is known for his plug track, Joina City, which transformed him into an overnight star before he released other tracks.
