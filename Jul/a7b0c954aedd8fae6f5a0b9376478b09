RENOWNED filmmaker Melgin Tafirenyika will be among the esteemed guests to grace the inaugural King Moshoeshoe Film Festival set for March 2020 in Lesotho, only a few weeks after attending a festival in South Africa. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Tafirenyika, whose film 5th Anniversary was selected for screening at a South African festival, is set to rub shoulders with renowned personalities in Africa’s film industry, including Osita Iheme and Genevieve Nnaji (Nigeria), South Africans Vuyo Dabula, Sean Drummond and Jerry Mofokeng, Lesotho’s Silas Monyatsi, Yvonne Okoro of Ghana, Flora Suya from Malawi, Boitshoko Jeremia representing Botswana and Cassie Kabwita of Zambia. The top filmmaker told NewsDay Life & Style that he was humbled by the recognition he has continued to receive.
He said he would use such opportunities as a platform to learn how best he can transform the local film industry for the benefit of the national economy. “I didn’t see it coming. God is so wonderful and faithful. Being chosen to rub shoulders with very famous actors like Genevieve, Osito, Vuyo and  other African icons is such a great honour. Two weeks ago, I came from a film festival that took place in South Africa where I had been invited. This continued recognition is a clear testimony that hard work pays,” he said. Tafirenyika said he would put the opportunity to good use as he learns new tricks from Africa’s film icons such as Nnaji, who recently became a billionaire after Netflix bought her film, Lion Heart, for N1 385 000 000 (US$3,8m). “As we strive to make our local industry viable, I look forward to learning how best we can tap into producing films that add value to our GDP just like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa,” he said.
