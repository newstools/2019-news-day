The Mugarden hit-maker said some of his pubescent moments in music unravelled in the country’s second largest city. Taking to social media, Winky D said his performance in Bulawayo was like a “rebirth” that helped him recast his focus. “Siyabonga… Allow me to express my heartfelt and profound gratitude to the organisers of the Bulawayo Arts Awards and my music family in Bulawayo for the Outstanding Arts Personality
Award. I am forever humbled by your support over the years, from the early days when I used to perform at Hustlers, Intwasa Festival and many more great memorable events,” he said. “It remains very welcoming every time I perform there. Admittedly, at the beginning of the year, in the midst of a rough patch, when tears were consistently blinding my focus, it was my performance in Bulawayo that birthed new hope and recast my focus.” The Gafa described the win — which he also credited to his team at Vigilance — as “sweet water served by the sincerity of my Bulawayo musical family. Ngiyabonga”. Meanwhile, other winners at this year’s awards include Novuyo Seagirl, who won Song of the Year for her track A.E.I.O.U and Outstanding Female Artiste, while Iyasa dominated the dance
awards, winning the Outstanding Male Dancer, Female Dancer and Arts Ensemble awards. Filmmaker Daniel Lasker walked away with two gongs — Outstanding TV/Film director and Outstanding Film for the short movie, The Man. Rapper Cal_Vin walked away with the Outstanding Male Artiste Award, while Asaph was crowned hip-hop king again.
