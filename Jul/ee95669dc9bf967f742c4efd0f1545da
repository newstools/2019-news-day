BY SANDRA MARICHO ZVISHAVANE-BASED Sungura star Gift Amuli yesterday said he was attracting huge crowds during shows in Mozambique as compared to those on home soil. Amuli said he had been performing in different provinces in Mozambique, adding he would be touring Manica Province from July 13 by public demand. “We normally have good attendance at shows outside the country as compared to local ones. Maybe the reason is linked to the economic situation we are experiencing as a nation,” he said. “Last month, we were in the province of Manica performing; that’s when we received an invitation to return on July 13. We were so excited with the reception.
That’s why we accepted the invitation.” Amuli said they had finalised their preparations for the show scheduled for this weekend and promised a top class performance. “With the current economic situation in the country, very few people can manage spending money attending shows, which is viewed as luxurious although we still
have a few places where our fans still fairly support us,” he said. He said the support from his Mozambican fans was unbelievable as they sang along to most of his songs, especially the yesteryear hit, Wamatuka. “Mozambicans are very amazing. They love my music and are very supportive despite the differences in language. I realised that, indeed, music is universal
language, where people can enjoy themselves without really understanding the message,” he said. Amuli is back on the music scene after he was forced to take a sabbatical when he sustained injuries in a road accident in Gweru early this year.
