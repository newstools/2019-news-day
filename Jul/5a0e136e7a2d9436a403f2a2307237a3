BY TERRY MADYAUTA FC PLATINUM twins Kelvin and Elvis Moyo are confident that they will secure deals with South Africa top-flight league side Chippa United, where they are currently trialling. The pair missed FC Platinum’s clash against Manica Diamonds last weekend, as they seek new fortunes. Kelvin, who plays as a centre back and has had runs with the Warriors, acknowledges that it will not be easy for the two of them to make the breakthrough, but they are working hard to make full use of this opportunity. “I am aware that it could be difficult to win a place here, but working hard is the only way to win everything in football,” he said. “I believe we have impressed so far and the hope is to secure a deal which obviously will give us a better platform to grow. Every player’s target is to grow
in the game and this is what we want to achieve here.” Both Kelvin and Elvis made their debut for FC Platinum in 2013 and  have been playing regularly under Norman Mapeza, helping the club to two league titles. They formed a formidable defence line with veteran Gift Bello and Raphael Muduviwa. After helping the club win its first title, they have attained heroes status in the mining town of Zvishavane, but they could soon end their romance with FC
Platinum fans if things go their way in South Africa.
