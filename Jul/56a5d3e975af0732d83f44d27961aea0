BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA WORSHIP musician-cum-journalist Nyasha Chingono — popularly known as Wenyasha in gospel music circles — is set to release his DVD album titled Taste of Glory on July 27, NewsDay Life & Style has learnt. The nine-track live DVD was recorded at Theatre in the Park and it features other top gospel acts, Ellard Cherayi and Takesure Zama. It was produced by Tafadzwa Chingono and Tinashe Ndhlala. Chingono told NewsDay Life & Style that the live DVD was done last year and has already released two singles from the album. “We did a live DVD of the album, Taste of Glory, last year and two singles were released. These include Ngavarumbidzwe,  an old hyme, which features Ellard Cherayi and people already
have a view on what the song is about. I also did another one with Takesure Zama called Musadzokere Kumashure, which is a remake of a 2015 song,” he said. The musician said he wanted people to be familiar with the songs on the album before the launch later this year.
“I want to take the album  out there first  before we do the launch; want people to sing along. They  should have the  idea of the songs on the album first.” The album carries songs like Ndomira Ipapo, Mweya Mutsvene, Dadisa, Holy and Anointed, Ngavarumbidwe, Senondo, Jesu Anogona, Mbiri Kuna Jesu and Musadzokere Kumashure. Chingono, popularly known for his track, Poreswa, said he had been encouraged by fans’ uptake of his music. “The uptake has been quite encouraging. People are receiving it well. Two weeks ago, I was in Bulawayo and I can say that people are loving my music. I also got invitations from South
Africa,” he said.
