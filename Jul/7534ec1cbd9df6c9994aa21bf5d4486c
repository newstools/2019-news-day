BY STEPHEN CHADENGA A 42-YEAR-OLD Mberengwa man is on the run after he allegedly fatally axed his grandmother over a cockerel she had sold. Trymore Sibanda of Chekwa village, Chief Mapiravana, struck his 93-year-old grandmother all over the body with an axe, leading to her death after she sold a cockerel for $15. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko confirmed the incident which happened last Tuesday, adding police had since launched a manhunt for Sibanda. “Trymore heard that his grandmother, Nyamazana, sold a cockerel for $15. He confronted her, arguing the said amount it was too little for the cockerel,” Goko said. “It is said an argument started, which resulted in Trymore  arming himself with an axe and struck his grandmother with it several times all over her body. Nyamazana collapsed and died on the spot. Trymore then ran away to an unknown destination.” Neighbours reported the matter to the police and Nyamazana’s body was taken to Zvishavane District Hospital. Goko said police were appealing to the public with information on Sibanda’s whereabouts to contact any nearest police station. “We also encourage people to solve disputes amicably as well as respect the sanctity of human life,” he said.
