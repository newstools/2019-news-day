BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER DENDERA musician Tryson Chimbetu will next week release a new video to the song Maria, off his 2018 offering, Kana Mazogara. The silky voiced crooner said all was in place for the video release. “We gave it our all, and we just can’t wait to share the new video with the rest of the world. Maria is one of the crowd favourites from the new album. We had
to give it preference ahead of the other songs,” he said. “We, however, have plans to produce more videos from other equally good songs off the new album.” Kana Mazogara has been hailed for its quality sound and the modern fusion, and Chimbetu concurred with the verdict. “Kana Mazogara has raised the bar. It’s a departure from the Tryson of old, known for laid back and sombre lyrics,” he said. The video, produced by renowned filmmaker and videographer Willard “Slimaz” Magombedze of SlimazPro, is a joy to watch. “We had to get one of the best producers in the land, and we are happy with the output. We hope the fans will attest to his quality work,” Chimbetu said. The affable dendera singer revealed that he was in the process of engaging a professional brand management company. “I am finalising engagements with  a local public relations and brand development company. I hope that deal and the sizzling hot video will mean good news for
my career,” he said. The Chihera singer said the video will be out next week and will be available on platforms like YouTube and Facebook. “We are excited about the work we put into the production. The choreography and everything in it demonstrate clarity of intent,” he said.
