Eight armed robbers last week reportedly pounced on a gold dealer at his homestead in Mudhindo, Guruve, and stole a vehicle, money, laptop, generator, television sets and mobile phones, NewsDay has learnt. By Simbarashe Sithole The matter was reported at Guruve Police Station under RRB number 3999606. Allegations are that on June 23 at around 11pm, eight robbers with fire arms stormed Chamunorwa Chizhare’s homestead in Guruve and demanded gold before assaulting the dealer’s family. Chizhare’s wife Florence Bhakina (33) handed over US$500 and ZWL$100 to the assailants. The robbers then tied Chizhare and his family’s hands and legs with electric cables. They then ransacked the entire house and took three plasma television sets, a generator, a Lenovo laptop, compressor and cellphones, among other small items. The thieves also took the car keys of the complainant’s newly imported and unregistered car and drove off. Mashonaland Central police spokesperson Inspector Milton Mundembe, however, said he was yet to receive the report.
In a related case, Chifamba Primary School head Sarudzai Matambudziko (54) of Mudhindo, Guruve, was also robbed on the same day by five armed robbers. The robbers scaled the perimeter fence of Matambudziko’s yard and used a bolt cutter to cut burglar bars. Upon gaining entry into the house, the robbers demanded cash from Matambudziko and her daughter, who first resisted, but gave up after being assaulted with iron bars. They subsequently surrendered their mobile phones, a laptop, ZWL$200 in cash, US$46 and a Steward Bank Kwenga point-of-sale machine. After the alleged robbery, one of the assailants was heard by the complainant saying they had robbed the wrong person. The matter was reported the following day at Mudhindo Police Base under RRB 3999607 and investigations are underway.
