BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA Tamba Events Company will host another Braai Out Fest on August 24 at Kingfisher Park in Emerald Hill, Harare, after the highly successful event held two months ago. The festivals are organised by company representatives Nigel Chinovhiringa and Blessing Gurupira. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style, Chinovhiringa said the forthcoming event would be an improvement on the previous edition. “From our first edition, we got a great turnout and we want to keep growing, hence we have enlisted some of the best acts in Zimbabwe. People wouldn’t want to miss this second
edition because it is going to be crazy,” he said. A star-studded line-up of Ammara Brown, Vimbai Zimuto, Ti Gonzi, DJ Kingfisher, Merciless Zim, Ashy Stylz and Nivek, DJ Eve and DJ Dollarbill will provide entertainment alongside
hosts Sarah Sinclair, Boss Kedha and Bhutisi. Chinovhiringa said they would adjust the starting time and there would be more meat and beverages as compared to the debut edition. “From the first edition, we learnt a lot and we have pulled every stop to make the second edition bigger and better. At the first edition, our starting time was 12 midday, but we had people at the gate by 9am. So, this edition, we have adjusted our time. The event is starting at 10am and ending at 12 midnight,” he said. “We took the plight of our fans to heart and we have engaged some supplier of beverages and meat. All I can tell our fans is everything will be at pump price. We want  to have a great time.” “People are free to bring their own drinks and meat in their cooler box even though we are going to be selling inside,” he said. At the last edition, Gemma Griffiths performed well and this time around, there will be more performances from more artistes.
