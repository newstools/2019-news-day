BY Richard Muponde A CONGOLESE refugee allegedly teamed up with his girlfriend to assault his wife of 25 years. Faustin Magorwa (46) and his mistress, Claire Kamaliza (30) of Tongogara Refugee Camp in Chipinge appeared this week before Chipinge magistrate Joshua Nembaware. They, however, both pleaded not guilty to assault and were remanded out of custody to July 19 for continuation of trial. In their defence through their lawyer, Admire Nkumbula of Mhungu and Associates, the two said the allegations were a mere waste of court’s time. “We deny the allegations that we assaulted her. This is just an abuse of court process,” they submitted. However, the complainant,  Preciose Nyiranzinga told the court that Kamaliza snatched her husband of 25 years. “I am married to Faustin and it’s our 25th year (together) this year and we arrived in the country from the Democratic Republic of Congo and settled at
Tongogara Refugee Camp. We built a shop together and when it was making money he was then snatched by Claire and he has since turned his back on me and also
became violent,” Nyiranzinga said. Prosecutor Sesekedzai Mayera told the court that on November 7 last year, Nyiranzinga fell ill and went to the shop to see her husband who she found sitting together with Kamaliza. The complainant then requested to have a chat with him away from his mistress. Magorwa, however, refused and instead started shouting at her, telling her not to disturb their peace. He also ordered her out of the shop, but the complainant refused insisting that his girlfriend should instead get out since she co-owned the shop. That angered her husband who started assaulting her with clenched fists and booted feet on the face and chest. Kamaliza also joined in and assaulted her with open palms on the face. Nyiranzinga suffered bruises on the face and chest and reported the matter to the police, leading to the arrest of the pair.
