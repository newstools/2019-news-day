SPEED merchant Marshal Mudehwe will be back at Mandava Stadium this Saturday, hoping to fire Manica Diamonds to a win against his former club, FC Platinum as the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League resumes following a two-week’s break. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Mudehwe helped the miners win two league titles and two Castle Challenge Cups before he crossed the floor to the Luke Masomere-coached side at the beginning of the season. He had become a bit-part player last season, owing to injuries and a dip in form and decided to move and seek more game time.
He said the clash with his former paymasters bears much significance in resuscitating his career. “I made a name at FC Platinum and I am here because they moulded me to the player I am, so the match we are going to play against them is very important to me,” Mudehwe said. “I don’t know if I will be selected into the team to play, but it will be a great honour for me. And like in any game, we will target maximum points. I hope we will do our best to collect maximum points against the champions.” The 25-year-old has three goals to his name since he joined Manica Diamonds and will be hoping he can be as productive against the Norman Mapeza-coached side. Wisdom Mutasa will also be facing his former bosses who he left for Slovakian side SK Senec together with Walter Musona back in 2015. Manica Diamonds currently occupy seventh position with 17 points and the newbies will look to cause an upset against one of the title favourites.
