BY SPORTS REPORTER HWANGE . . . . . . . . . .(1) 1 BULAWAYO CHIEFS . . . 0 HWANGE arrested their seven match winless streak with a narrow win over basement side Bulawayo Chiefs at the Colliery Stadium yesterday. Kasimero Chimbadzwa, on his debut, scored the priceless goal for the coal miners in the 25th minute, and although the home side went on to dominate the contest, they could not increase their goal tally on the day. Veteran defender Gilbert Zulu and Dingani Maphosa both struck the woodwork for Hwange. The visitors improved towards the end of the match, but it was generally a comfortable afternoon for Hwange, who should have won the match by a wider margin had they managed to convert the numerous chances that came their way. The victory moved Hwange out of the relegation zone, up to 13th position on the log standings with 17 points. Hwange goalkeepers coach Edmore Sibanda was happy that his team had managed to collect their first set of three points since April. “We are happy that we won. The team played to our instructions and we got three points, which is a good result that we wanted,” he said. “We don’t want to lose more points going forward so we will try to collect as many points in the next matches.” Hwange play Chicken Inn in their next match. Bulawayo Chiefs coach Farai Tawachera blamed the defeat on the team’s goalkeeper David Bizabani, who he said was also responsible for the team’s previous defeat. Asked in a post-match conference to give his opinion and what could have gone wrong for them to lose the match, Tawachera said: “Honestly, there is nothing that went wrong besides the goalkeeper. He made mistakes against FC Platinum, he gave them three goals. “We thought after this two-week break, he would come back a changed man, but again, he gifted Hwange a goal out of nothing. We could have won this game, but after giveaway goals, obviously it becomes difficult to raise the game from such moments.”
