BY Staff Reporter Foreign Affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo yesterday said there was no turning back on reforms President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government was implementing and pleaded with the United States (US) government to remove sanctions against Zimbabwe. Speaking at a reception to mark the 4th of July celebrations at the new American embassy in Harare, Moyo said the government welcomed US companies to invest in Zimbabwe, but wanted “outdated impediments” like the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (Zidera) to be removed to send a signal to the world that the African country was sincere and ready to do business. “The new dispensation is committed to re-engaging the US government. We call upon the US government to join us based on mutual trust and commitment,” he said. “The reforms we are implementing are irreversible and aimed at improving the livelihoods of Zimbabweans.” US ambassador to Zimbabwe, Brian Nichols said Zimbabwe now faces a choice, whether to accept the challenge of implementing the political and economic reforms that will fulfil the promise of its democracy, or to postpone the path to progress and prosperity. “Two hundred and forty-three years ago, America’s founders affirmed that all of us are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he said. “We stand with the people of Zimbabwe as they pursue their unalienable rights at this decisive moment.” Nichols said in the last year, the US gave over $300 million of assistance to better health, food security, democratic governance and education for the people of Zimbabwe, including
US$3,2 million in aid to the victims of Cyclone Idai — which includes an additional US$600 000 provided this week.
