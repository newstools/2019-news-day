BY SHARON SIBINDI DRUMS of Peace will premiere its new children’s play, Parliament of Animals, at the Bulawayo Theatre on August 7. The play is based on a folk tale which targets children between four and eight years. Drums of Peace founder Lewis Ndlovu said this was not their first children’s play as they had also created several other products in collaboration with
different theatre groups and schools in the city. “This is not our first production. This time, the new production will be produced with my one long-time standing pre-school friend, Newton. The production will
be celebrating five years of partnership and good relationship between us,” he said. “We have been practicing for the whole term as well as doing drumming lessons that we teach, practice and then present to parents. This will be a special day.” He said the play, produced by Ndlovu, is in both English and Ndebele. “This Ndebele folk tale, told in English, is a fun story of animals living together in the bush, and has serious lessons on good governance and the
environment,” he said. “The play tells a story that is close to my heart, as I love playing and teaching children.  It’s is about a dry spell—drought and the sneaky actions of hare.
But for the deeper meaning; the play teaches us not to be selfish, no matter how big or small one is. We also learn that cheats never prosper.”
