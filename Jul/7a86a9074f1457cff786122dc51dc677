Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the accident yesterday. “I can confirm that Manu Chiwa, who was 35 years old, died on Wednesday  on admission at Bainbridge Hospital after he was involved in an accident at the 319km peg along the Beitbridge-
Bulawayo Highway,” Ndebele said. “He was driving a Honda Fit vehicle which was following behind another Honda Fit, and there was a bus coming from the opposite direction. He lost control of his vehicle and hit another
car from behind and died from injuries sustained on admission at the Beitbridge hospital.” Beitbridge East legislator Albert Nguluvhe (Zanu PF) said Chiwa worked hard for both the party and the people behind the scenes. “He played a very big role during our 2018 election campaigns. I was with him up to late last night (Wednesday), discussing developmental issues for the constituency,’’ he said.
