BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO PLAYWRIGHT Thandiwe Mawungwa has been selected to represent the country at the Ojai Playwrights Conference (OPC) set for California in the United States from July 28 to August 11. Almasi Collaborative Arts associate artistic director Zaza Muchemwa confirmed the development. “Mawungwa was selected to take part in the conference as part of the ongoing partnership between Almasi Collaborative Arts and the former. Playwrights who would have participated at the Almasi Playwrights Conference at a particular year are encouraged to send their work to the Ojai selection committee for consideration. It’s this process that saw Mawungwa being chosen,” she said. Mawungwa’s selection followed her submission of the play, 33 Cents, to the OPC following the African Playwrights Conference hosted by Almasi in January. Mawungwa, who will be featured in the event titled, Wake Up! Imagining Our Future in the evening of August 4 at Zalk Theatre, said she felt honoured. She expressed gratitude to Almasi executive artistic director Danai Gurira for playing a pivotal role in her selection. “I feel greatly honoured to have been selected to be part of the Ojai Playwrights Conference. I would like to thank Danai for creating a platform where local writers like me can develop and showcase their works internationally,” she said. OPC’s artistic staff solicits unproduced plays from writers, agents, theatres, other developmental programmes, educational institutions and through online submissions. Plays are read and evaluated by a reading committee of artistic professionals in the theatrical community. Only eight playwrights are then chosen for a two-week long residence programme in California. Over the last 10 years, Mawungwa has written, directed and produced plays for theatres, schools and organisations in Africa and Europe. Four of her plays have won multiple awards locally and regionally.
