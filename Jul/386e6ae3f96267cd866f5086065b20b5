BY WINSTONE ANTONIO THE “bad boy” of Zimdancehall Soul Jah Love and former wife Bounty Lisa may have gone their separate ways in a messy divorce, but the couple is set to rekindle their stage romance when they perform at the former’s album launch at Harare Gardens on August 9. Since parting ways, the duo has not shared the stage. But this is set to change, courtesy of Patson Chimbodza of Chipaz Promotions, who is organising the Zviri Pandiri Zvihombe album launch. Soul Jah Love and Bounty Lisa, at the peak of their love, shared an amazing stage romance that won the hearts of their fans at concerts and public performances around the country. The Ndini Uya Uya hit-maker’s launch will also feature an array of both seasoned and upcoming artistes. Chipaz told NewsDay Life &Style yesterday that preparations for the event were at an advanced stage. “Some problems  are always there and happen everywhere. As a professional promoter, I have overlooked what happened between the two artistes in the past to
bring them together for this special event,” he said. “It is good for the industry that Bounty Lisa as a professional artiste has confirmed her performance at the launch, among other guest artistes who are
promising sterling performances.” Chimbodza said they were happy with the preparations for the launch and called on music fans and promoters to come in their numbers. The launch will be graced by over 30 artistes, including Killer T, Freeman, Shinsoman, Enzo Ishall, Jah Signal, Tocky Vibes, Guspy Warrior and Lady Squanda,
with Gary B, Judgement Yard, DJ Cables and DJ Mbale.
