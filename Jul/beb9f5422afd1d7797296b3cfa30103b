BY REX MPHISA SUPERMODEL Charlyn Muleya is set to represent Beitbridge at this year’s Miss Tourism Zimbabwe national finals after shrugging off stiff competition from eight other models gunning for the Miss Tourism Beitbridge crown at the weekend. Muleya also won the Best National Costume award for her dress, which was adorned with colours from the Zimbabwe flag. The first princess, Roynah Kassim, was also voted Miss Personality while Belinda Moyo, the second princess, was the winner of Miss Talent. Cadel Anashe Tombo won an online poll, which saw her being crowned the People’s Choice. The guest of honour, Miss Tourism Zimbabwe licence holder Sarah Mpofu-Sibanda, saluted the pageant organiser, former Miss Zimbabwe-US Vanessa Mbedzi, for a job
well-done. “I want to congratulate Vanessa for a professionally arranged show. She has won herself the licence for Miss Tourism Beitbridge. She has put up a wonderful
piece as we sit in this magnificent building,” she said. Guests were entertained by urban groover Trevor Dongo and a host of local talent, which saw the guests dancing the night away.
