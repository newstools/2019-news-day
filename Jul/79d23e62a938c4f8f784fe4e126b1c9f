BY FREEMAN MAKOPA TOP movie producer and songwriter Marc Mandisoul’s duet with Jamaican artiste Nyanda, Mayhem, has been selected the soundtrack for an American comedy titled Tall Girl, NewsDay Life & Style has learnt. Marc Mandisoul said this was a milestone in his career. “It is quite an achievement for me in the sense that I have managed to link up with Netflix and Universal studios,” he said. “This will not only benefit myself, but the whole sector because we have managed to place our country on the world map.” He said the challenge for local creatives was now to produce work that meets international standards. The comedy, showing on Netflix, is centred on Jadi, the tallest girl in her school, who has never quite felt comfortable with her height. All of that, however,
changes when she falls for a handsome and equally tall foreign exchange student. As a result, Jodi gets embroiled in a surprising love triangle, which helps
her realise she’s far more than her insecurities about her height have led her to believe. House of Stone producer has been dominating the global market with his productions, among them State of Malambia and has also struck a deal with the Universal
Music Group in the United States. Mandisoul, who is receiving 10% royalties from the song, said the project had proved lucrative. “The first version of Mayhem featured South African rapper Gigi LaMayne and a local DJ, V Candy and I worked with Shayzar of Mix Masters and Anonzi Xndr on
production after creating the concept. This new version is performed by the Kemist, featuring Nyanda,” Mandisoul said. He also disclosed that House of Stone is his acting debut and its something to look forward to as he prepares himself for a move to Miami in 2020, where he
will not only be behind the scenes, but pushing his career as an actor as well.
