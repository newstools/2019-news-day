MUSICIANS Tocky Vibes and Mbeu joined a campaign against drug abuse at a highly subscribed event held at Rugare Primary School in Harare on Saturday. BY LIFE &STYLE REPORTER The event, organised by the Uniting Presbyterian Church in Southern Africa (UPCSA) was held to raise awareness on the negative effects of the use of drugs and to promote healthy habits among youths. “The church is the salt and light of the earth and our putting together this event is in response to the growing trend of drug and substance abuse among youths,” said event coordinator Susan Mumba. Mumba, who is also the convenor of UPCSA Health and Wellness Committee, said the church was called to minister to every person. “Ministry goes beyond church on Sunday. It is a daily responsibility and embarking on such edutainment programmes we are spreading the gospel and also preserving the society,” she said. Speaking through his manager, Tocky Vibes said the event was an emotional return home for him. “Rugare will always have a special place in my heart as I grew up here. My message to my peers and those younger is to look after themselves and desist from drugs,” he said. Mbeu said it was important for musicians to partner various sects of the community in addressing societal challenges. “Music is empty if it does not impact the society. We sing not just to entertain, but to inform and educate,” he said. The event is part of a series of nationwide activities lined up to raise awareness of the dangers of drug abuse.
