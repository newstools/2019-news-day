BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE A HARARE court yesterday postponed to July 27 the case of retired University of Zimbabwe vice-chancellor Levi Nyagura due to the presiding magistrate Munamato Mutevedzi’s absence. Nyagura, who is accused of abusing his authority by allegedly and single-handedly awarding former First Lady Grace Mugabe a Doctor of Philosophy Degree (PHD), had his case temporarily stayed by the High Court pending the application for review against the lower court judgment, which dismissed his application for exception. Allegations are that, sometime in 2011, Nyagura accepted and approved Ntombizodwa G Marufu’s application to study a PhD in Sociology without the knowledge and recommendation of the departmental board and faculty of Higher Degrees Committee in violation of UZ quality assurance, guidelines and benchmark.
