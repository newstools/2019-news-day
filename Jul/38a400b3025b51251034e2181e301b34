The chanter took to the stage under the new look on Saturday night at the revived Ganya Night Club at Gazaland in Highfield. The artiste, who is popular for his club bangers that include Ndiratidze Zvaunoita, Unorarika and Karikuvharira Paghetto, has been away from the stage for a while. His new manager, Collin Jichichi told NewsDay Life & Style that the artiste had to rebrand to dress like Jamaican dancehall kings. “Ricky Fire is among the artistes who started dancehall music in Zimbabwe. His comeback will be refreshing for the crowds because he is a grown artiste and has upgraded his music,” he
said. “He now dresses like Sizzla Kalonji and Capleton and as a leader, he is expected to lead by example.” At the Saturday gig, Ricky Fire performed songs such as Mbuya Kwindi and Ndiri Munhuwo, a duet with Bounty Lisa, as he also celebrated the birth of his son. Ganya Night Club owner Milton Muganda said they brought the artiste to Gazaland in line with the club’s vision to be a hub of all forms of music entertainment in the ghetto. “As you have noticed that we have often brought sungura artistes, but as part of our vision to brand Ganya as the paradise for ghetto music, we will be having Ricky Fire and more
artistes from different genres,” he said.
