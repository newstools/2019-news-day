Luck ran out for three thieves from Odzi after they drank stolen tobacco chemical after mistaking it for beer. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Lovemore Garudzo (39) Grand Garudzo (23) and Prince Garudzo (19) appeared before Mutare magistrate Tendai Mahwe facing charges of theft. The trio pleaded guilty to stealing from their uncle Elphas Mukurunge at his Whitgirl Farm in Odzi and were slapped with a three-year jail term. Six months of the sentence were suspended for five years on condition of good behaviour, while another six months were suspended on condition that they restitute their uncle ZWL$3 000. Prosecutor John Munyurwa told the court that on June 26, the three broke into the complainant’s tuckshop and stole a water pump, five litres of petrol, tobacco chemicals and other goods. Mukurunge discovered the theft immediately and went to the accused persons’ homestead and found the trio vomiting after they had ingested the chemical. Upon asking them about the theft, they denied the allegation. The complainant, however, saw his water pump in a tobacco barn and made a police report. The trio then confessed the theft and revealed they were suffering from severe pains after drinking the tobacco chemical.
