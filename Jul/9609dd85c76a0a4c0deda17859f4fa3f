BY TERRY MADYAUTA GWERU-based side Chapungu have announced the arrival of former Caps United gunslinger, Brian Muzondiwa. Chapungu coach Rodwell Dhlakama is hoping that the 27 year old will establish himself at the club after an unsuccessful stint  at Caps United before he joined Eastern Region Division One side Green Fuels. Addressing a Press conference in Gweru yesterday, Dhlakama confirmed the capture of Muzondiwa, with high hopes that he will end their barren spell. “We have not been scoring goals of late, and I am confident that Muzondiwa’s arrival will change our fortunes as far as scoring goals is concerned,” said Dhlakama. “The way we were playing before the break was bad, and I hope we move a gear up and keep pressure on the teams leading, as well as relief ourselves of pressure from the teams behind us. “We are going to get more players to strengthen our squad so that by the time we reach the mid-season break, we will be in a comfortable position to claim a spot among the top teams.” Muzondiwa is available for selection for their assignment against Dynamos tomorrow. The Airmen have also loaned Malvin Nyauyanga to Northern Region side Blue Swallows. Meanwhile, Dhlakama has warned Dynamos to expect a tough test when they lock horns at Rufaro Stadium on Sunday. “Playing Dynamos comes with a lot of motivation. Whether they are losing or not, they present an interesting test for us. “We are gunning for maximum points, just like any other team would do. The points will not come on a silver platter, because we have to work hard to get them. “It’s also high time we end the narrative that Chapungu always lose to Dynamos. We need to win this game, if we are to improve on our position or if we are to maintain it.” Chapungu are fifth on the PSL log,  with 19 points on their tally, five behind log leaders FC Platinum. So far, they have lost three matches against Chicken Inn, Harare City as well Yadah and have gone for five matches without a win.
