THE Mines and Mining Development ministry yesterday temporarily suspended its Mashonaland Central provincial office services with immediate effect to pave way for thorough investigations into allegations of unprofessional conduct by staffers. BY MISHMA CHAKANYUKA In line with the “Zimbabwe is open for business” mantra and the thrust for zero tolerance to corruption, the ministry in a statement said it would be investigating all complaints of malpractices by its staff. The suspension will last until July 10. “Following the suspension of several of the technical staff at the Mashonaland Central provincial office, it has become necessary to temporarily suspend all services offered by that office with effect from today, Friday July 5, 2019, until end of day, Wednesday July 10, 2019, to allow the ministry to put in place measures to enable sound service delivery while investigations are in progress,” the statement read. “During this period from midday today, July 5, 2019 until end of day, Wednesday July 10, 2019, a minimal skeleton staff will be manning the office to attend to any urgent issues which may arise from stakeholders.” Suspended staff members at the Mashonaland Central province include the provincial mining director. Similar investigations have also resulted in the suspension of surveyors at the ministry’s Mashonaland West provincial mining office. The ministry apologised to stakeholders for any inconveniences which might be caused by the temporary suspension of services, but assured it was being done in the public interest. The Mines ministry also assured that all cases of malpractices would be investigated, with necessary corrective action being taken extending to peggers, where they were found to be complicit in malpractices, while tracking mechanisms were also being put in place.
