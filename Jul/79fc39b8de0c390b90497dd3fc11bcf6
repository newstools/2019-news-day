THE inaugural edition of the Unlocked Gospel Music Competition organised by CSBC Zimbabwe, in partnership with ZB Bank, kicked off on Saturday at the Harare Gardens. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA The competition is an interdenominational music competition that seeks to unify churches through praise and worship revival sessions. Seasoned gospel artistes, including Sebastian Magacha and Nyasha Mutonhori, were among the performers competing for the ultimate prize. “The Saturday event was the first of the five stages of the competition. In the first and second rounds of the competition, the judges decided which performances went through to the next round, with the public deciding who would go to the next round by voting on social media platforms as well as on mobile network SMS shortcode platforms,” Nobert Mavunga, CSBC Zimbabwe group chief executive, said. Participants also included Seventh Day Adventist’s Firm Faith, Roman Catholic’s St Agnes Parish and United Methodist Church’s Vabvuwi. Mavhunga said the competition was open to anyone talented in music, but on the understanding that the project was strictly a gospel music platform. There is over $15 000 in cash prizes to be won at the various stages of the competition. The winner of the first round pocketed $1 000, while in the second and third rounds winners will walk away with $2 000 and $3 000 respectively. The fourth round will see the winner taking home $4 000, while the grand finale winner will be awarded $5 000 and a recording contract. ZB Financial Holdings group chief executive Ron Mutandagayi said the bank sponsored a lot of community activities, including competitions as a way of giving back.
