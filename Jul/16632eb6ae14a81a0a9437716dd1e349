others. We are on tour for six months in total and right now, we are happy to be in Kazakhstan for the first time. We hope to continue as ambassadors of our wonderful country in our
own small way and so far, we have been doing well despite challenges we may face,” he said. Gora said the band had also managed to do a collaboration with a Northern Irish band, Two Door Cinema Club, on a song titled Satisfaction, which he said guaranteed their bid to
spread wings in different countries. “We did collaboration on a song titled Satisfaction Guaranteed with famous Indie band Two Door Cinema Club,” he said. The song was produced by Jacknife Lee, one of the world’s top producers and multiple Grammy Award winner who has worked with U2, Taylor Swift, Robbie Williams, The Killers and Snow Patrol, among others.
