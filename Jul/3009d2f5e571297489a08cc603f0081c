BY PRECIOUS CHIDA DANCEHALL chanter Romeo “Shinsoman” Anthony is trying to get his groove back, with hopes pinned on the recently released five-track compilation, which he said is dedicated to women. Shinsoman told NewsDay Weekender Life & Style that the songs are meant to appreciate women. “We should not look down on women because behind every successful man, there is a woman. So, I want to tell the world to respect and not to harass our women,”
he said. “Some of the tracks like Mai Oyi Oyi, featuring my long-time friend Yoz, are about praising women. The Beauty and Power of a Woman talks about how powerful a
woman can be and their influence in our lives as men.” The Mawaya-waya hit-maker roped in different producers to come up with the album, among them Oskid Productions, Tyfa Guni of Ice and Rose Productions, Cymplex
and Coke Studio Africa and Young DLC. “We want this project to have a different sound because different producers add a different touch to the cake.On this extended play, we want to up our game in
terms commercialising our music because before being an artiste, I’m also a family man who needs to fend for the family,” he said. Shinsoman said they had diverted from dancehall music and were now also into afro-pop. “The sound of this project is not dancehall. We wanted to it to be heard by all the audiences we can think of, regardless of the genre they love listening to.
So, the beats were afro-pop and one of the songs is a reggae song,” he said. Tracks on the album also include, Celebrity, Daddy Vakabaka and Zvane Musiyano.
The Ndakupenga hit-maker seems to be regaining his mojo as he has been staging shows abroad. For instance, his previous show in Canada. Renowned as the ‘Dancehall Father’, Shinsoman is one of the pioneers of Zimdancehall, but appears to have recently elbowed out by new and upcoming talent.
