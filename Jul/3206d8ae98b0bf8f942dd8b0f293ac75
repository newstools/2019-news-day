BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA GOSPEL singer Liberty Mutasa and the Intimate Worshipers are set to drop their debut  album, Moments of Intimacy Volume 1, on July 19 at Heartfelt International Ministries, in Ashdown Park. Mutasa said the eight-track album was inspired by his desire to lead people to a place where they could experience God. “My greatest inspiration on this album was the desire to lead people to a place where they can meet with their God, experience his power and see him as the only solution to every situation,” he said. “The album talks more about Jesus, what he did for us on Calvary, how he can set us free from every chain that binds us and also encourages us to always see victory in every battle we face.” The album,with songs including Mweya Mutsvene, Calvary, I see Victory, I am a Testimony, Ndichagara Naye Pasi (featuring Kudakwashe Mandizvidza) and Jesu Mwari Wemunana, was produced by Cornelius Muponda. Mutasa said the music journey required patience and an intimate relationship with God to be able to release songs timely. The musician acknowledged his pastors Tavonga and Chipo Vutabwashe for their guidance and mentorship as well as the Heartfelt Choir leaders for its leadership. He said his dream was to work with top-rated gospel musicians like Michael “Minister” Mahendere and worshiper Lawrence Gunda, whose work he found inspirational because of “their consistency” and “powerful revelation in song composing”. Mutasa recorded two songs — We Join the Angels and I know a Man — with Heartfelt Choir in 2013 before he started working on his forthcoming album.
