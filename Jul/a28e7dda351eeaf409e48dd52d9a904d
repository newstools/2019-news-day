BY OBEY MANAYITI The Nelson Chamisa-led  MDC yesterday said it was ready to prove its governing prowess when it launches its Road to Economic Recovery, Legitimacy, Openness and Democracy strategy dubbed Reload in Harare today. Party spokesperson Daniel Molokele said they are ready to silence their critics by charting a viable way forward for Zimbabwe. “The MDC is not a mere opposition party, but we are ready to govern and we have an alternative strategy, including an alternative policy approach to governance,” Molekele said. “Tomorrow (today) when we launch the Reload document, we are giving direction to the country and we are also able to clarify the uncertainty of criticism we get that we are all
talk and without alternatives. “We are hoping that the policy document that we are launching will help to set us as an alternative government to show everyone we are ready to govern and actually better in
terms of policy, compared to Zanu PF.”
