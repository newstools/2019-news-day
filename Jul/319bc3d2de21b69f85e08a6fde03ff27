BY PRECIOUS CHIDA ALL is set for the Miss Tourism Beitbridge slated for this Saturday at Kingdom Light Auditorium in Beitbridge. The pageant, which starts at 7pm, will see nine models competing for the coveted crown —Mignonette Ngwenya, Charlyn Muleya, Caddel Anashe Tombo, Clara Rudo Matongo, Roynah Kassim, Michelle Kabudza, Belinda Moyo, Loveness Karidzira and Valentine Makere. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, event coordinator Vanessa Mbedzi said prize money and a contract will be up for grabs by winners of the pageant. “The three winners will get prize money and hampers from Crossing Beitbridge Company, an exclusive photoshoot with Domain Media and a one-year contract with AM
Model Management,” she said. Mbedzi said the selected queen will represent Beitbridge at the national finals set for Harare in September. Mbedzi, who is also former Miss Zim-US, said models should be between ages 18 and 24, unmarried and with no children, intelligent as well as confident. She said the models were also expected to go through three categories on the final event. “Nation Pride is the first category in which they are just going to show their Zimbabwean pride through outfits created using the Zimbabwean colours. The
second category is safari wear, with the last category being evening wear,” she said. Veteran urban groover Trevor Dongo is expected to grace the pageant alongside Beitbridge artistes Master GSky, The Hoxers,  Bhadilah,  LB the Moh,  Prince
Adrie and Mic Charmer. Last year’s Miss Tourism Beitbridge saw Ruvimbo Thandeka Mukandatsama being crowned winner. She went on to participate at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe finals.
