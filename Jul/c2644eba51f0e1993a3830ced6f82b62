BY FORTUNE MBELE CHICKEN Inn are willing to release striker King Nasama to Highlanders and have given the Bulawayo giants a go ahead to talk to the player, who is also wanted by ZPC Kariba. Nasama’s handler Gibson Mahachi last week confirmed that the two Premiership clubs had declared interest on the striker, who is currently struggling to get some regular game time at the Gamecocks. Mahachi wants to find his player a team where he will play frequently. Chicken Inn secretary Tavengwa Hara yesterday said they had received formal communication from Highlanders over Nasama. “Highlanders wrote to us and we have told them that they can start negotiating with Nasama, even on a permanent basis,” he said. “We have told Highlanders that if the boy is agreeable, he can even start training with them while they engage in the negotiations.” ZPC Kariba have also reportedly tabled an offer for Nasama, who joined Chicken Inn last year from Dynamos, but has failed to find game time. Highlanders technical manager Mandla Mpofu has often complained about the team’s blunt strike force. At the weekend, he said the club was after a striker, and while he did not mention a name, sources told this publication that they had identified Nasama as the
player who can solve their scoring problems. “The position we find ourselves in is not looking good. We are not scoring goals and it is one aspect we have to work on,” Mpofu said. Highlanders have scored eight goals only in 14 matches, with four coming from goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda from the penalty spot. The other goals were scored by Prince Dube, Ray Lunga, Cleopas Kapupurika and defender Peter Muduhwa.
