BY FARAI MATIASHE THE Marketers Association of Zimbabwe (MAZ) has donated shoes worth US$1 000 to Mathew Rusike Children’s Home. Speaking during the handover ceremony, MAZ secretary-general Gillian Rusike said the donation was part of proceeds raised through a golf tournament held last year. “We have donated shoes to two schools in Masvingo and then we decided to take some home, here in Harare. The idea is to ensure that our little kids go to
school while well-dressed and looking presentable,” he said. MAZ board member Rose Chisveto said it was her organisation’s mandate to make a difference. “We want to make sure that these children (are warm) this winter season,” she said. Reverend Linrlelink Mutendzwa commended MAZ for the donation. The orphanage is currently home to 200 children.
