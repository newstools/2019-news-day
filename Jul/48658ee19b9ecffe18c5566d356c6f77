BY PRECIOUS CHIDA MUSICIAN Hope Masike has released the long-awaited video for Idenga, the first single off her upcoming album, The Exorcism of a Spinster, which is set to be launched on July 26 at Reps Theatre in Harare. While Idenga can be translated to “It is heaven”, the track takes on a sensual tone as Masike croons seductively in appreciation of the attentions of a lover that take her to some “heavenly” heights. The songbird told NewsDay Life & Style that the song was designed to celebrate “the yummy things” associated with blissful romance. “It’s a praise song to a lover who has been good to you. Much like how in many African cultures, a woman would do praise poems using her husband’s totem as
encouragement for him to fulfil his duty as a lover,” she said. Masike’s costume in this video is a rich visual feast which complements the steamy kind of love vocalised by the songstress. The two main protagonists in the video, a male and female dancer, undulate seductively across a set bathed in low sensual lights, while being serenaded by
Masike and her band. The video was directed by Nikita Little and shot at The Red Tent and the Mbira Centre. Masike said her third offering will be promoted and distributed under a United Kingdom based record label, Riverboat. Affectionately referred to as the ‘princess of mbira’, Masike is also a fashion designer and visual artist, and has been recognised informally as an ambassador
of Shona customs and culture. She has taught about African music in various European countries during her tours.
