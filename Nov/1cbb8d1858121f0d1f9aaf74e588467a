BY KENNETH NYANGANI TENAX will be confirmed as champions of the Eastern Region Division One Soccer League at the weekend if they can avoid a drubbing in their last game of the season against Ruwa. The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services side thought they had secured the title last weekend, which comes with league promotion, after they beat Grayham 2-0 in Mutare. The victory saw them opening a three point gap on second placed Buffaloes, who dropped two points after getting held by Chiredzi. Tenax have 65 points while Buffaloes have 62, and the log leaders enjoy a healthy +11 goals difference over their nearest rivals. So for them to lose the title, it means that they will have to lose heavily against Ruwa, and at the same time Buffaloes should harvest an avalanche of goals against Green Fuel in their last match. Tenax wildly celebrated their win at the weekend, probably knowing that it would be a miracle for Buffaloes to get their desired result in the next match. However,  they were not handed the trophy with the Eastern Region Division One Football league secretary Wisdom Simba saying they will only confirm Tenax as champions once all the probabilities have been established. “We are waiting for the last round of fixtures before we can confirm our winners. This is football as you are aware and anything can happen. “Our season has gone well so far with no issues of match fixing and we hope this will continue until the very last day,” he said.
