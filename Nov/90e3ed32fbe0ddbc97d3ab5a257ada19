By Ruvimbo Muchenje Harare City Council has secured $15 million from government to construct proper structures for vendors at the Coca-Cola flea market along Seke Road. Council spokesperson Michael Chideme said the new infrastructure will accommodate 1 600 traders once completed. Chideme said council was still mobilising more resources for the project. “We are still at procurement stage, but I cannot give you timelines yet,” he said. Council has been struggling to remove vendors from the central business district to designated areas like along Simon Mazorodze and the Coca-Cola area.
