Power utility Zesa asked miners to pay for power in foreign currency in return for uninterrupted supplies, but has failed to stick to the agreement. “As a direct result of these power cuts, the group recorded a decrease in production by 8% to 962kg from 1 050kg achieved in the comparative period in 2018.
