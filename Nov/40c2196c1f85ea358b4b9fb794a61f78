BY SHARON SIBINDI TOP Bulawayo socialite, Gilmore Tee, is set to showcase at one of Africa’s leading fashion platforms, GTBank Fashion Week, in Lagos, Nigeria, this weekend. The exhibition, running from November 9 to 10, is a consumer-focused fair and free business platform, designed to showcase the best of Africa’s growing fashion industry. Gilmore Tee (pictured), who recently made it into this year’s Forbes list, would be joined by Danayi Madondo, the head of Haus of Stone, who will be showcasing their spring/summer 2020 collection-Seed of Esther. “It was and is important for me to learn from others on how they are pushing fashion in their individual countries, the idea being to come back home and implement that into our own system,” Gilmore Tee told NewsDay Life & Style. Gilmore Tee expressed excitement at being invited to attend the GTBank Fashion Weekend at a time Lagos was slowly becoming the African fashion capital taking over from Cape Town. “Any opportunity to learning and exchanging dialogue is greatly appreciated. Apart from attending, I will be doing public relations for the brand Haus of Stone, which I believe is the leading fashion brand in Zimbabwe, right now. I am a fan of their story telling, aesthetic and world class approach,” he said. Gilmore Tee, the brains behind the Intwasa Fashion Show and iFashion Fest, has worked immensely with some of the outstanding Zimbabwean fashion brands such as Ara Kani, Nkanyeziyethu Malunga, Sanah Designs, Bakhar and Thembani Mubochwa.
