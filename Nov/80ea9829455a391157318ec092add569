BY CHELSEA MUSAFARE CONTEMPORARY rhumba artiste Farai “Juntal” Serima is preparing to launch his third album titled Public Demand later this month after releasing a bonus love song from the album two weeks ago. Juntal recently told NewsDay Life & Style that his fans should expect the best from the new offering. “Many people have been demanding more after the hit song Mutupo and I have done my best not to disappoint. The album is coming with nothing, but hit songs,” he said. The self-proclaimed king of rhumba said he received his talent from God and so he was devoted to using his music to send out positive messages. “The inspiration of my music is the people around me, my experiences and the things that I also imagine. Most of all, this is all from God to send good messages to the world through my music,” he said. Juntal said his forthcoming production —which is the third in his discography — reflected the experience he has gained through his many years in the music industry. “When you gain more experience, definitely things do change, from the message and how one creates their music. This album carries a lot of messages. People associate me with dance music, but sometimes it is not just about making people dance, but giving them good music that will change their lives, understand what love is and how to love,” he said. Juntal said he avoided producing seasonal songs because they did not have a longer shelf life and he wanted his music to be still relevant even after 20 years. The eight-track album was produced at Rocklife Media and recorded by Marlon from Propa Bless.
