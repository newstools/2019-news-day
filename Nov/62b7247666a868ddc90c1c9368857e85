Subsidies and other Market Distortions Market distortions associated with subsidies present an additional risk to macroeconomic and fiscal stability. In particular, subsidies on fuel, electricity and agriculture have, in the past, led to large and often unpredictable expenses. Where subsidies are deemed essential and can be financed,these will need to be clearly targeted and reflected in the Budget with adequate budgetary provisions. To ensure effective implementation of the proposed subsidy policy, additional measures will be taken to tighten eligibility to subsidised goods and services so that only those who are eligible can benefit. Fuel and Electricity Pricing Government has already instituted new pricing frameworks for fuel and electricity that adequately reflect costs, including those resulting from changes in import prices and exchange rate fluctuations. The pricing framework for fuel also ensures that pump prices remain comparable to those charged in neighbouring countries, so as to remove arbitrage opportunities arising from illicit fuel exports. The 2020 Budget Objectives and Thrust Mthuli Ncube says the 2020 National Budget marks the exit from austerity to growth stimulation and employment generation era through promotion of production oriented investment and productivity, without losing focus on fiscal responsibility. The 2020 Budget prioritises the following areas: • Productivity and growth;
• Jobs creation;
• Competitiveness;
• Promotion of more sustainable and inclusive development;
and
• Export diversification and import substitution. The growth and productivity thrust will be supported by the reengagement process with the International Community which will enable us to meet our Budget objectives. The State of the Economy Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube says the year 2019, started with good prospects,following the introduction of key macro-fiscal reforms aimed at stabilising and resuscitating the economy, in line with the Transitional Stabilisation Programme (TSP) objectives. Allow me to share a quote from Orson Whitney (A famous religious leader):“No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted …, it ministers to our education and development…” The reforms, which were centred on “Austerity for Prosperity” were in no way a retribution, especially in view of the fact that our public finances were not balancing, following years of unsustainable fiscal deficits. To correct that, the New Dispensation had to put aside the notion of short cuts, magic solutions, and loose funding, by strengthening fiscal discipline and tightening monetary policy, in order to start rebuilding the economy. This primarily entailed switching priorities from unproductive fiscal operations to sound and responsible fiscal spending, which placed the fiscus on the right path. And indeed, during the course of the year, specific millstones were made, particularly in sanitising public finances, implementation of structural reforms, infrastructure
rehabilitation, social services delivery, among other achievements. With regards to the fiscus, implementation of fiscal consolidation reforms saw consistent monthly budget surpluses or savings reaching ZWL$1.4 billion between January and August 2019. Similarly, the current account managed to deliver a positive balance of US$116.4 million during the first half of the year, which all pointed to positive signs for restoring the much needed macro-fiscal stability, and elimination of the ‘twin deficit’. 15:24  Industry and manufacturing Local content strategy will increase exports and industrialisation..
