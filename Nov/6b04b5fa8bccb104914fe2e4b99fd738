Zimbabwe, November 2019 – MediPay, a Zimbabwe-based health care finance provider, has partnered with
UK-based Fintech company, SympliFi, to enable Zimbabweans to finance their health care related expenses
using their family abroad as guarantors. MediPay provides affordable and flexible medical payment plans to patients unable to afford the upfront cost
of a medical procedure or equipment, or where medical aid does not cover the entire cost. MediPay finances
medical procedures and equipment, such as wheelchairs. Authorisation and processing can be completed
within 24 hours and payment made to the medical provider immediately. The economic conditions in Zimbabwe have made it increasingly more difficult for people to afford access to
medical services, as more than 90% of the population is uninsured and those insured a burdened with huge
shortfalls. Recognizing these challenges, MediPay partnered with SympliFi to enable Zimbabweans in the
United Kingdom to serve as guarantors to help their family back home finance health care costs. SympliFi’s
digital service enables the diaspora to complete the guarantor process in a matter of minutes on their phone;
and most importantly, it is a fee-free service for the guarantor.
“We believe access to healthcare is a basic human right. In that spirit, our services enable access to appropriate healthcare services while removing the discrimination of upfront payments,” stated Jackson Kanhenga,Non-Executive Chair of MediPay. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3096224744036870" src="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/simplifi.png" alt="" width="1200" height="667" srcset="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/simplifi.png 1200w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/simplifi-300x167.png 300w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/simplifi-768x427.png 768w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/simplifi-1024x569.png 1024w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/simplifi-30x17.png 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />
