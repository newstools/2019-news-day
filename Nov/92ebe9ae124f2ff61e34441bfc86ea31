BY TERRY MADYAUTA CHAPUNGU midfield magician Denver Mukamba is plotting to put up one of his best shows when he comes against his former employers Dynamos in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Ascot Stadium tomorrow. Mukamba comes up against the club that made him popular for the first time since his return from the wilderness, having taken a break from the game last season. The forward wants to shine on the big occasion against the most popular team in the country. Dynamos have been struggling for form and have drawn all of their last eight matches and Mukamba is determined to capitalise on that slump in form. He said the match against DeMbare was very important to him as an individual as well as for Chapungu. “It’s a very important and emotional match to me. I have to prove myself, I have to inspire in this one,” Mukamba said. “Matches like this come with a lot of pressure, but it is my target to inspire a win in this match. “Dynamos are a big team which I respect a lot, though in this match, we need maximum points and it will be a great honour for me to get a goal for my current club. “We lost our last match and we want to collect maximum points in this one because dropping points means we also drop on the log. “Our coaches have stressed on the need to collect as many points as we can until the season ends so that we may probably achieve our season’s objectives.” Chapungu lost their last assignment 1-0 away to Yadah Stars and they will be looking to bounce back to winning ways against Dynamos. However, Ascot has proven to be a favourable hunting ground for Dynamos, as they have collected maximum points at this venue for the last three seasons against the same opponents. The reverse fixture between the two sides ended 1-0 in favour of the Tonderai Ndiraya-coached side and they will be looking to complete a double over Chapungu.
