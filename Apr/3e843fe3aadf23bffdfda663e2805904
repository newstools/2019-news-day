BY Kevin Mapasure The Zimbabwe national cricket team will be looking to record a rare series whitewash when they take on touring United Arab Emirates (UAE) in their fourth one-day international (ODI) at Harare Sports Club this morning. Zimbabwe lead the series 3-0 and have hardly been tested throughout the past three matches and the trend is likely to continue. UAE will be looking for improved show following their 131-run defeat on Sunday, while Zimbabwe will be looking to make the series result emphatic. It is likely that Zimbabwe selectors could choose to give other players who have not been involved in the series a run. Among those that have sat out every match so far is former captain Elton Chigumbura as well as the uncapped pair of Ainsley Ndlovu and Tony Munyonga. Regis Chakabva, the preferred gloveman for the first three matches, has done well, but after falling cheaply with the bat in the last match, he will be looking to bounce back today as he looks to cement a place in the team for future challenges. Captain Peter Moor has led from the front so far this series with some good batting displays that saw him claim the man of the match accolade in the second ODI. Craig Ervine has also continued on his rich vein in the domestic competitions that preceded this series and he will be looking to improve his records. Sean Williams recorded a brilliant century in the last match and he will see this as another opportunity to hit another hundred. The bowlers will, meanwhile, be looking to do better, particularly the seamers who shared four wickets between the three of them on Sunday.
