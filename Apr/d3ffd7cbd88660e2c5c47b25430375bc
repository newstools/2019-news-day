This ceremony is a recognition of the growing importance of the Chinese community in Kano, the largest city in northern Nigeria, BBC Hausa editor Jimeh Saleh says. There are a lot of Chinese businesses and traders in the city who are sometimes accused of taking other people’s jobs and engaging in unfair competition. Mr Zhang will be a vital link between the Chinese community and the locals.
