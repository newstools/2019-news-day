BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE ZVISHAVANE-BASED sungura artiste Gift Amuli of the Wamatuka fame has been fingered in a dagga case at Guruve Magistrates Court after he was cited as a supplier of the dangerous drug. This came to light after Shawn Bhofa (23) of house number 1033 Majawi Street in Mvurwi was dragged to court on charges of possessing 310g of dagga. Bhofa pleaded guilty when he appeared before magistrate, Artwell Sanyatwi, on Tuesday. The self-confessed drug peddler was yesterday sentenced to 12 months in prison, with six months suspended for three years. In his plea of guilty, Bhofa implicated Amuli as his supplier: “Your worship, I admit to possessing this drug, but my supplier is Gift Amuli, the musician. He sends it to me on a weekly basis for resale. I work for him as a drug peddler.” Prosecutor Carson Kundiona told the court that on Friday last week, at around 12 noon, police officers stormed Bhofa’s homestead after a tip-off that he was selling drugs. When they arrived at his house, they found his brother, Raymond, who they ordered to call Bhofa. The convict was called and came back home. On seeing the police details, Bhofa fled from the scene. The police ordered his brother to surrender the drugs. Bhofa was finally arrested on Monday after the police followed up on him, and he failed to produce a license that would allow him to be in possession of the dagga.
