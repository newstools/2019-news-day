BY KENNETH NYANGANI Castle Lager Premier Soccer League side Manica Diamonds will learn whether they will be able to use Vengere Stadium in Rusape for their home matches today after the Zifa First Instance Board makes another assessment of the facility. Manica Diamonds picked Vengere Stadium as their home ground after Sakubva Stadium in Mutare failed to meet the Premier Soccer League standards. The Rusape Town Council has been conducting renovations on Vengere ever since it was condemned. If Vengere fails to make the grade, then the Gem Boys will have to play their home matches at Gibbo Stadium in Triangle. Manica Diamonds chairperson Masimba Chihowa told NewsDay that they are looking forward to the inspection with optimism. “At the moment, I am not able to say that we are going to use Gibbo Stadium because the  final inspection of Vengere Stadium will be held tomorrow (today) by those who are entitled to inspect. That is all I can say,” he said. Football fans in the eastern border city will be hoping that Vengere Stadium is certified fit, so that they can travel a shorter distance to watch their team. Vengere Stadium in Rusape is about 94km away from Mutare. Playing at Gibbo Stadium will be a big cost as the team would have to travel more than 300 kilometres. Chihowa said the team will bounce back from a 2-0 defeat at the hands of  Caps United at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. “We lost, but it’s too early to speak about our performance, we are going to improve in our next games,” he said. The Premiership newcomers succumbed to John Zhuwawo and Joel Ngodzo’s first half goals.
