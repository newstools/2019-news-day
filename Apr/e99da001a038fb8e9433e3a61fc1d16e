CHAPUNGU . . . . . . (0) 1 Army side Chapungu yesterday caused an upset, defeating Triangle at home in a Castle Lager Premier League match played at Gibbo Stadium. Triangle came into the match oozing with confidence after last week’s 1-0 win against Highlanders. Yesterday, they were largely expected to record another win and even a draw would have disappointed the home fans. In the first half, both teams created few scoring chances, taking cautious approaches. Chapungu created their first chance on 33 minutes, but goalkeeper Marion Chang saved from an Ian Nyoni well-taken shot. The home side’s Timothy January was also denied by Chapungu goalkeeper Talbert Shumba minutes before half time. Nyoni continued to show his brilliance in the second stanza and was to be rewarded in the 65th minute, beating the badly exposed Chang. The visitors then fortified their defence to shut out the home side. Triangle gaffer Taurai Mangwiro said Nyoni should have been flagged offside when he scored the solitary goal. “I believe the game was evenly balanced until the their goal came. I am not a crybaby, but everyone, including the Chapungu players, saw what happened, but if someone decided that it was not an offside, then we have to revise the laws of the game,” he said. Chapungu coach Rodwell Dhlakama, however, saluted the Triangle goalkeeper, saying his team could have won by a bigger margin. “I think their goalkeeper was instrumental because we could have scored two or three goals. For me, their goalkeeper is the man of the match because we created good chances in the first half,” he said. “In the second half, we created one chance and we scored. It’s a good result playing away from home.”
