MAB is set to host the second leg after the Bulawayo Athletics Board successfully hosted the first leg in February.

The tournament would be used as part of the selection process of a team to represent the country in a continental meet in due course. “We have stepped up preparations to host the JM Busha 54 Triangular Series second leg. The dates have already been confirmed (April 20) at Mutare Boys High,”
he said. “We are expecting athletes from around the country to come in their numbers and participate in the tournament. We have a brilliant technical team which is ready to assist athletes in their races. The tournament will be used to select athletes that will represent the country at a continental meet.” Bussinessman Joseph Makamba’s Busha company poured in $10 000 to sponsor the three legs with the third one pencilled for Harare on a date yet to be announced.
