BY SHARON SIBINDI INKULULEKO Yabatsha School of Arts (Iyasa) and Austria’s Theatre Ansicht premiered a musical theatre on how to cope with the death of a loved one targeted at young audiences. The act, titled Mozart is Dead, was launched on Saturday in Vienna, Austria, at the Dschungel Wien Theatre for young audiences and will run at the theatre between April and May. Iyasa director Nkululeko Innocent Dube told Southern Eye Life & Style that the 50-minute musical theatre is about the after-life. “It is told from a child’s perspective who tries to understand what happens after death; where do people go and what connects them to their loved ones they leave behind?” he said. “The targeted audience are children and family. Children from the age of six can watch the production. This is a story for young audiences and it was sold out and was well received by the audience. The feedback was positive.” The piece, he said, had emotional musical thoughts about the transition from life to death and opens with one of the actors, Tilda, walking onto the stage with a sombre expression. The piece was authored and directed by Flo Staffelmayr with the help of Julia Meinx (musical direction and choreography), Dube (musical creation and direction), Lukas Lauermann (music), Vincent Hendus (stage), Silvia Scheibelhofer (costume), Christina Rauchbauer (external eye) and Agnes Zenker (production). The two theatre groups last year worked on a production, Radio Freedom, which was launched in Europe.
