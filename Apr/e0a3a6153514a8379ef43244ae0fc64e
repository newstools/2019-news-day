BY  KENNETH NYANGANI Businessman Joseph Busha, who funds the JM Busha 54 athletics triangular series wants to see the country become the best athletics nation on the continent. Busha said he will continue to fund local athletics in a bid to see his dream realised. The second leg of the 2019 series took place in Mutare over the weekend, following the first leg that was hosted in Bulawayo earlier this year. Busha, who graced the tournament in Mutare, said the country should nurture talent to compete at the highest level and emulate the Kenyans athletes who have done well in the long-distance categories across the globe. “What inspires me is that sports, arts and culture bring people together. Through learning, you can bring people together and through dancing you also bring people together as well as through culture.  I took the decision to sponsor the JM Busha athletics tournament because I am very aware that sports plays a critical role in empowering our youth,” he said “There is need to nurture talent, we have talent in the country and it is through these tournaments that they get the much needed exposure. We are saying let’s emulate the Kenyans because they compete everywhere in the world and they are doing well.” The tournament is used as part of the selection process of a team to represent the country in a continental meet in due course. Busha’s company poured in $10 000 sponsoring the three legs with the third set for Harare on a date yet to be announced. Veteran athlete Millen Matende won the 5 000-metre senior men’s race which was the main attraction. Matende said he was using the event to prepare for continental tournaments later this year.
