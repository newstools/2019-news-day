BY PHILLIP CHIDAVAENZI in Lusaka, Zambia Bread of Life Church Zimbabwe leader, Lewis Shikapwasha, on Saturday night launched three Christian books at a colourful ceremony held at the Hilton Inn Hotel in the Zambian capital. The three books are Commitment, Disciple or Multitude? and When Eagles Face Storms. Shikapwasha, who came to Zimbabwe three years ago on an assignment to establish the Bread of Life Church in the country, described the triple launch as an expression of his passion. “The launch of the three books is an expression of my passion for God, kingdom and family,” he said. Shikapwasha said he was alarmed by the rate at which true, genuine Christianity seemed to be declining, despite the numerical growth in churches. “One thing that has been in my heart is that the Christian faith is declining. We are deceived by the numbers we see in church because there is no reproduction,” he said. “In the next 50 years, the Christian faith will go into extinction if we don’t raise disciples. “God has given us a mandate to win souls. “On Commitment, I have been a Christian for 19 years and have missed church only three times.” Shikapwasha said the books help readers, both in and outside the church, to understand true discipleship, genuine commitment to God and surviving seasons of discouragement. The gospel minister said he was seeking to deconstruct the myth that Christianity was a walk in the park. “Being a pastor, there had been instances I thought I should quit the ministry,” he said. “If there is a soul we don’t care for, it’s the pastor. We are looking after other souls, but our souls are neglected.” Shikapwasha has published five Christian books.
