BY SPORTS REPORTER Dynamos and Highlanders have been handpicked to contest this year’s Independence Day trophy, which will be played at the National Sports Stadium, where the main celebrations for the country’s Independence will take place. The format for the competition has been changing over the years, where in a few occasions, the tournament would kick off with the semi-finals. Organisers are not taking chances this time by inviting the two crowd pullers for the Uhuru celebrations, hoping that the football match would help fill up the stadium. DeMbare and Bosso have both struggled in their first matches of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League and both will be trying to use this competition to find elusive form ahead of their league matches on Monday. But the two giants will also be thrust into a dilemma as to which players they can use for the Uhuru trophy since they have bigger challenges coming ahead. Dynamos have had problems with injuries and have failed to put together a full strength squad in all their three matches in the league so far. Highlanders coach Madinda Ndlovu has never been afraid to throw in his reserves for such matches and it is likely that he will go the same route, as he seeks to keep his stars wrapped in cotton wool ahead of their league match. Meanwhile, DeMbare, who have a largely new squad in place after the off-season overhaul, may see this as another opportunity for them to continue in their process of gelling as a team. Over the years, the two giants’ clashes have produced fireworks, never mind who they field, and this match is expected to be another one that will linger long in the minds of their fervent fans.
