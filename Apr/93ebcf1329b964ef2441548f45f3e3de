BY MUNYARADZI MADZOKERE CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe is delighted with the impact of two of his marquee signings during the off-season, Phineas Bamusi and, in the team’s impressive unbeaten start to the Premier Soccer League season. Chitembwe watched Nyoni score a goal as well as assist Joel Ngodzo, while Bamusi delivered  the cross that was converted into goal with a glancing diving header by Dominic Chungwa in a 4-1 rout of Bulawayo Chiefs on Sunday. The Harare giants are among the pacesetters in the race for the league title at fourth place with a total of 10 points, three behind log leaders and defending champions FC Platinum, having played one match less. Only Caps and FC Platinum are yet to taste defeat in the current season, having played four and five matches, respectively. Nyoni, who crossed the floor from Highlanders during the season break, has two goals in four matches for his new side and has found the back of the net in the last two matches. Bamusi has been at his menacing best in the wings since his return from Triangle. “We knew that Phineas (Bamusi) and Gabriel (Nyoni) were going to give us that kind of pace in the wide areas. This is our weapon now,” Chitembwe said. “And even if our opponents know that it’s one of our strong points as a team it is still difficult to contain them because at the end of the day you really have to have the right kind of quality to contain them. “And not many players around can contain Phineas and Nyoni on their day, so we are delighted to have them and I am pleased with their contribution so far,” he added. And with the problem now solved with the acquisition of the two pacey wingers and the return of Ronaldo Chitiyo, who can also be devastating coming from a wide position, from injury, Makepekepe are already looking like genuine title contenders. Caps play Harare City in a potentially explosive Harare derby this weekend.
