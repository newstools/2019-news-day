By Freeman Makopa Zimbabwe’s top bodybuilding enthusiasts are in for an intriguing contest as some of the best athletes line up for the PPC ZITF Open tournament to be held at the Bulawayo Theatre on April 27. South Africa-based three-time champion and current holder of the title Ndumiso Dlodlo will be defending his title and faces stiff competition from rivals. Fast-improving Francis Chideme, Lovemore Munyamana, Kylie Macdonald, Sinini Nxumalo, Marko Mwale, Nomphepe Mugoni, Ngonidzashe Gwama, Blessing Sithole and Chamunorwa Marange are some of the athletes expected to compete for the big crown in the men’s category. Other categories to be competed for are men’s fitness, women bikini fitness, women beach bikini, junior men up to and including 23-year-olds and wheelchair men bodybuilding sections. National Federation of Zimbabwe Body Building and Fitness secretary-general Quiet Shangai said the competition has provided opportunities for athletes to showcase their talents. “The ZITF Open has grown from strength to strength. It has provided opportunities for athletes to showcase their talents. The mere fact that we have six national champions including Dlodlo, Blessing Itai Sithole, Shantel Batch, Michelle Matsito, Tatenda Justice Chikuhwa and Chamunorwa Marange from last year shows how the competition has opened opportunities for athletes,” he said. “For the first time in history ZITF will have more than one senior men bodybuilding division and more than one men’s physique division. There will be up to 75kg and over 75kg in the senior men bodybuilding division. The two winners will compete for the overall title. There will also be two men’s physique division, including 176cm and over 176cm,” he said. This year, the tournament has seen Iron Lion Nutrition and Supplements, Proton Bakeries, United Refineries, Musclerage, Bodyworks, Veezed Tyres and Intercape coming on board to sponsor the country’s top bodybuilding event.
