BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE VETERAN dancer and musician Precious “Wasu Dacoda” Makwame said she is polishing up her third album titled Kumazivandadzoka, set to be released next month. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style on the sidelines of her Sunday performance at Club Joy Centre in Highfield, Wasu, the leader of Syndicate dance group, said the five-track album was meant to beef up her stage work and make her a better and well-known dancer. “I am polishing up my third album, Kumazivandadzoka, to be released next month together with its DVD. The album is already complete and we are now working on the DVD to spice up our dance routine,” she said. Having danced for singer Taruvinga “Shuga Shuga” Majokoto and Enisia Mashusha’s Mambokadzi dance group, Wasu eventually formed her Syndicate dance group in 2015.
She released her first album titled Lory in 2015 that was followed by Chitaitai. Wasu is married to Macheso’s dancer, Albert Mariya   and the couple has one child. Meanwhile, music promoter and Club Joy Centre proprietor David Mudzudzu said he was committed to giving forgotten and upcoming artistes a chance to perform at his club. “We have a forgotten artiste like Wasu and other upcoming artistes who I am giving an opportunity to showcase themselves to the people. I am proud that Andy Muridzo and Jah Prayzah came through here and shone until today,” he said.
