BY FREEMAN MAKOPA A TEAM of six athletes is scheduled to leave for Shandrani Mauritius next month to take part in the Africa Triathlon Championships slated for June 1. The team which comprises of Matt Denslow, Luke Hacker, Luke Steffens, Andie Kuipers and Mikayla Colegrave will compete in the U-19 category, while George Ascott will battle it out in the 13/14-year category Triathlon Zimbabwe national coach, Pamela Fulton said the association has lined up events to prepare the athletes for the continental showcase. “Triathlon Zimbabwe will be hosting a set of swim, bike and run time trials during the school holidays to ensure the athletes are well prepared. Another set of trials will be held two weeks before departure to select the relay team.” “Both Lukes (Hacker and Steffens) are bottom of the U-19 category so they will be travelling to gain experience. Matt has a good chance of medalling as do Andie and Mikayla. George is the correct age to compete at the next Youth Olympic Games so he is travelling to gain experience and also has a good chance of medalling,” she said. At the championships, the first day will see the youngsters competing in their individual races and then on the second day, the ladies and the U-19 men will compete in the mixed relay event. Trials are still to be held to confirm the relay team. The mixed relay event will be introduced for the first time at the African Champions.
