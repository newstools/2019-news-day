BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO FILM production house, Megacom Pictures, is now geared for season 2 of the Marbles series — which premiered last month in Harare — with a bootcamp for aspiring actors pencilled for May 3 to 5 at Hunyani Hills. Marbles director Manuel Matsinye told NewsDay Life & Style on the sidelines of the premiere of Shungu DzeMoyo on Saturday last week that the camp would be a platform to groom new talent and promised fireworks on Marbles Season 2. “It’s a transition from season 1 to 2. It’s essentially ushering us into shooting Marbles Season 2. You are going to see fresh faces. The story gets tighter and thicker with twists and turns, plus a lot of drama. In terms of picture quality and sound, the new season is going to be above the previous standard,” he said. “We have a lot of tired faces in the industry, so at the camp we will groom new talent.” The Megacom Pictures co-founder said the camp would combine Marbles cast and crew with that of a forthcoming drama series, Contested, which interrogates traditional and contemporary laws of inheritance. “All the productions will be shot simultaneously. Contested questions our culture on its deliberate inclination towards the boy child over his female counterpart when it comes to issues of estate and inheritance. The drama series is far bigger than Marbles in terms of budget, cast and other production requirements,” he said. Matsinye said the bootcamp would be unique and characterised by different activities that include script-read-through as well as training aspiring actors through workshops on TV and film production. “(These include) how to relate with the camera, directors and producers and how to handle fame and the media. There will also be gymnastics, preaching and braai,” he said. “The reason why dramas (many) are not interesting is because they lack solid scripts.  Script reading is very important to us.”
