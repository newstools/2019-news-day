BY STAFF WRITER GOSPEL musicians Jennifer Maneni and Daisy Mukariri are set to lead thousands in song at the burial of Karoi cleric and politician Chenjerai Kangausaru’s mother in the farming town today. Gogo Kangausaru (88) passed away in South Africa on Monday after a short illness. Maneni, who has done a song titled Hamunyare, which highlights issues affecting the girl child, said she would celebrate the life of a woman who had a passion to help the vulnerable members in her community. “I will play my own part to honour the life of this compassionate woman who inspired us and her son to stand in the gap of the vulnerable members of society,” she said. Mukariri said she was inspired by the fact that the late Gogo Kangausaru received Christ after her son preached to her. Kangausauru — who was expelled from Zanu PF in 2013 after she contested the Hurungwe East constituency as an independent candidate — was recently re-admitted into the party together with former Security minister Didymus Mutasa and former war veterans leader Jabulani Sibanda. Kangausaru, who is a Family of God Church pastor, pledged to build a classroom block each for two schools in the locality in honour of the love his mother showed for the community. “I will build two blocks in honour of Gogo Eteri at Tengwe and Chinhere schools, as wells as sponsor the education of two girls at the schools as a way to remember her legacy,” Kangausaru said. Gogo Kangausaru is survived by her husband Dan Kangausaru, 12 children, 50 grand-children and 26 great-grandchildren.
