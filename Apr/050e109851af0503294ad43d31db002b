BY KENNETH NYANGANI EASTERN Region Division One football side GreenFuels dropped two points at home after they were held to a 1-all draw by Melfort in Chisumbanje on Saturday while Tenax continued with their good start after dispatching Chiredzi United 4-1 in the Lowveld. GreenFuels, who had been touted as favourites to clinch the sole Premier Soccer League ticket from the region, lost their first match 1-0 away to Tenax before the weekend setback. The Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services side Tenax have exhibited their pedigree to go all the way. All the attention has been given to the Taku Shariwa-coached GreenFuels following their huge investment in the squad. During the pre-season, the team embarked on a massive recruitment drive that saw them capture some of the country’s top players, including former Triangle players Hillary
Bakacheza and  Moses Gutu. They have also in their ranks former Caps United striker Blessing Muzondiwa, ex-Shabanie player Pervington Zimunya  and Dillon Chivandire, among others. Shariwa said his team will soon bounce back. “It’s too early to start ruling us out. I have confidence in my players and in myself; we know how to turn around fortunes.We will walk the talk. It is time to show who are the
bosses and in five games everything will start to make sense,” he said Former top-flight side Mutare Rovers collected their first set of maximum points after registering a 2-0 home win against Mwenezana at Sakubva Stadium. Rovers lost their first match 2-1 against army side United Lions in Masvingo.
