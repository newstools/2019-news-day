By Munyaradzi Madzokere Noah Ferenando is the new Zimbabwe Table Tennis Union (ZTTU) president after he was unanimously elected at the elective annual general meeting at Chapman Golf Club in Harare on Saturday. Ferenando, who has been instrumental in the development of the sport in Mashonaland East replaces John Muringani, who resigned from the position last year. The new executive that will lead Zimbabwe table tennis for the next four years include vice-president Luba Ndlovu from Bulawayo, secretary-general Tinashe Duri (Harare) and treasurer Ntokozo Moyo (Manicaland). “I feel honoured to be unanimously elected by all the provinces and commissions. I will always treasure the position given to me by the general council,” Ferenando told NewsDay Sport. “It is my wish to help propel table tennis beyond imaginable heights. I wish to also put more weight on capacity development and grassroots development of the sport beyond race and geographical locations. I think it would be important also to decentralise the adminstration of the sport from national, provincial, district up to ward level,” Ferenando added. Ferenando is also vice-president for the African Union Sports Council (Ausc) Region 5 in Table Tennis. Ausc Region 5 is a southern African block comprising 18 countries. Table tennis has been steadily growing in the country in the last few years especially at grassroots level with help from the Chinese community in Zimbabwe. However, the new ZTTU executive’s immediate task will be to align the union’s constitution with that of regional and international bodies. “Our immediate is to have a constitutional amendment to align it to the AUSC Region 5, African Table Tennis Federation And International Table Tennis Federation and current sports trends in line with proper sports governance,” Ferenando said.
