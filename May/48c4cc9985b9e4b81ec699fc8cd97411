BY TERRY MADYAUTA CHICKEN INN gaffer Joey Antipas has heaped praise on the former Dynamos trio of Brett Amidu, Valentine Kadonzvo and Tichaona Chipunza, who have been in scintillating form as the Gamecocks ride high in the current Premier Soccer League (PSL) campaign. The exciting trio have already established themselves in the team, where they have helped the Bulawayo side emerge as one of the serious contenders for the PSL main prize. The 2015 Champions currently occupy second position on the log table with 18 points, just a point behind pacesetter Caps United. Kadonzvo and Amidu joined from Dynamos, while Chipunza came in from Ngezi Platinum, having previously played for DeMbare. While Amidu struggled for form during his stay at FC Platinum and Dynamos, the 24-year-old has rediscovered the form that once sparked interest from a number of local clubs back in 2016. Antipas observed that the former Dynamos players had brought flair and stability to his squad. “We are dark horses in this race, but it’s how we play that matters most at the end of the day. I believe the current crop of players we have are good enough to do business for us,” he said. “Though I normally do not want to handpick players when the whole team is doing good, but the guys who joined us have been doing well. Brett, Chipunza and Vale have done well to stabilise the squad and everyone else has been at the top of their game. We are hoping this form will continue until the end of the season.” The Gamecocks also snapped Panashe Mutasa who is a former DeMbare player, but he has only made sporadic appearances. At the weekend, they accounted for the scalp of one of the high-riding side, Chapungu, 3-0 and will be looking forward to continue with the winning ways when they host Black Rhinos on Saturday.
