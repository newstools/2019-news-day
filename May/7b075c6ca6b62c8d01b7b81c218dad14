BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER GOSPEL musician Mathias Mhere’s new album will now be launched on June 21 following a postponement necessitated by his elder brother’s death earlier this month. Mhere told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that everything was now set for the new album, A Greater than Solomon, at The Venue in Avondale. “We are now going ahead with the launch of the new album on June 21 at the same venue,” he said. Mhere said he had since included a new track dedicated to his late brother Tungamirai on the album. Tungamirai, died from injuries sustained during an accident that occurred in South Africa last month. “I have done a track for my brother called Chipangamazano, in which I celebrated his qualities,” he said. Mhere described his brother as a passionate supporter of his music as he had also featured on the video for the song, Favour. “He was very supportive of my music and I’m definitely going to pen a song for him on the forthcoming album. The song is just to remember him. He loved music too, although he didn’t sing professionally,” he said. He said they experimented with a wide range of sound on the album after incorporating some of the country’s top producers Lyton Ngolomi, Mcdonald “Mcdee” Chidavaenzi and Tapiwa “Maselo” Jera. Mhere said Tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira and Goodness and Mercy Ministries leader, Tapiwa Freddy, would be the guests of honour.
