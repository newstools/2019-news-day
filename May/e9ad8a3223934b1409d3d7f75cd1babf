BY KENNETH NYANGANI Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services side Tenax stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches after dispatching United Lions 3-0 in an Eastern Region Division One Football League match played in Masvingo over the weekend. The Mutare-based side are enjoying the cool breeze at the summit of log standings with 19 points. Former Premiership side Buffaloes are on 15 points following their 3-0 away win against Bikita. Mahaka FC put up a strong display that saw them dispatching Chiredzi FC 3-0 and they held on to third position with similar points with Buffaloes. GreenFuels continued with their resurgence under newly-appointed gaffer Chastern Ndongonda after posting a crucial 2-1 win against seasoned campaigners Mwenezana in Mwenezi. The Chisumbanje-based side moved into the top 10 for the first time this season and club chairman Fredson Moyo yesterday said they are looking to invade the top four in a few weeks. “There is no room to drop points at the moment, we are 10 points behind log leaders, we need to be in the top four as soon as possible and then we start to push for what we want (top spot),” he said. “We started the league poorly and we are not where we should be,” he said.
