Online London — Macauley Bonne might be offered the chance to play at a much higher level after an outstanding season with Leyton Orient, firing the Londoners to the National League title. And it seems that the prolific goalscorer has no interest in walking away after establishing himself as a modern-day Orient legend. According to talkSPORT, Steel City rivals Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United are going head-to-head for the Zimbabwe international, who is also a target for North East neighbours Sunderland and Middlesbrough. Charlton Athletic are keen too, while Leicester City, perhaps looking to replicate the success of Jamie Vardy, are eyeing another forward with a remarkable record in non-league. Bonne scored 23 goals in 46 games as Leyton Orient won the title. Now, with a £200 000 a release clause in his contract, Orient would be powerless to prevent their star man leaving if anyone is willing to pay such a bargain fee. But don’t rule out the prospect of the 23-year-old choosing to continue his journey at Brisbane Road. “Now I can show everyone in League Two what I can do hopefully,” he said. “Where else would I want to be? I’m the main man at the minute. My eyes aren’t being wondered whatsoever.” A spell in the fourth tier could be a sensible idea for Bonne, who maybe needs to prove himself in the Football League before making a move to the likes of Leicester, Sunderland or Sheffield United. If he maintains that one-in-two ratio in League Two, however, it seems only a matter of time before he will be given a chance higher up the footballing pyramid.
