BY MISHMA CHAKANYUKA State-owned telecommunications firm NetOne has introduced a new mobile data package in a bid to cushion its customers in the face of rising costs. Last month, mobile network operators hiked data tariffs by more than 100%, a development which squeezed consumers who are already struggling with falling disposable incomes. In a statement, NetOne spokesperson Eldrette Shereni said the new package of night social media bundles will be charged in RTGS$. “The pricing of all the new packages in RTGS dollars, at a time when most companies have resorted to charging in foreign denominations, is a welcome development and a clarion call for all businesses to adopt a customer value-driven approach,” she said. “NetOne will continue to create products and services through which subscribers can derive value from. The group’s aim is to transform and develop communities through communication solutions.”
