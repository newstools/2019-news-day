BY TERRY MADYAUTA Three-time Mr Zimbabwe and ZITF bodybuilding champion Ndumiso Dlodlo is targeting the Muscle and Fitness Classic set for Gweru today. The show returns to life after eight years, having last been held in 2010 due to financial constraints. It will be held at the St Theresa Cathedral. Dlodlo headlines a cast of athletes that includes veteran bodybuilder Wesley Sanders. The list also includes five budding bodybuilders from a Bulawayo-based fitness gym, Body Works, including some who participated in a tournament held in Botswana recently. These include Kylie MacDonald, Prechard Hoko, Delvin Page and Zibusiso Khumalo. However, Dlodlo told Newsday Weekender Sports that he wanted to prove that he is one of the best bulks Zimbabwe has to offer. “I am here in Gweru for the first time and am very excited and I want to take this contest to prove that I am good among many. “I am happy to compete here, because it is my dream and as for tomorrow (Saturday), I will do my best to win this show,” he said. The main categories to be contested include junior men Under-21, seniors lightweight below 70kg, middleweight 70kg to 80kg and light heavyweight 80kg to 90kg. A huge turnout is expected at what will be one of the biggest bodybuilding contests in Gweru this year.
