NGEZI PLATINUM . . . . . . 0 The match promised a lot, but offered very little in the end as Dynamos’ struggles continued following a goalless draw against Ngezi Platinum Stars at Rufaro Stadium yesterday. Dynamos coach Tonderai Ndiraya was also looking to get one over his former paymasters seven months after unceremoniously leaving the club, but it was not to be. The match was far from entertaining with goalscoring opportunities few and far in-between. A draw is, however,  an upgrade for the Harare giants, who succumbed to an embarrassing defeat away to Bulawayo Chiefs last week. Ngezi coach Erol Akbay, who is yet to lose to DeMbare in the league in five encounters, had promised good football which they tried to exhibit in the first half, but had to change the plan on a bumpy Rufaro pitch. And the Dutchman felt his team has lost two valuable points. “I have never lost to Dynamos. That’s very nice and it should remain that way,” he said in his post-match interview. “Today, it’s two points dropped. We had a problem with the pitch because in the first half we tried to play football from the back and we were making a lot of mistakes. That is why in the second half we tried ‘kick and run’ football to create chances. There was not good chance because this is not how we play football, which is why I am happy with one point, but I feel we lost two points,” the Dutchman added Ndiraya felt his side controlled the match though they failed to fashion clear-cut chances. “It was an interesting game, with a lot of history behind it. We really wanted to win today, but we were playing a very good side with good players. I thought overall we were in control of the game, but there wasn’t the fluidity we wanted as a team,” Ndiraya said. The best chance of the game came barely seven minutes into the game with Dynamos’ Godfrey Mukambi pulling the trigger from outside box, but the ball ricocheted off the post.
