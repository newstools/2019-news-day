Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe is confident that his inform side can go and conquer the Hwange test when the two sides clash at the Colliery on Sunday. BY GERALD MUTSVAIRO Caps United currently sit on top of the Castle Lager premier Soccer League table ahead of Chicken Inn and champions FC Platinum, who are one and two points behind, respectively. Hwange, who made a good start to the campaign, appear to have lost their way, having won just one of their last five matches. They lost their last two matches, one of which was a home defeat to Chapungu, and another against Caps.
Chitembwe admits that facing Hwange in their fortress poses a big challenge, but he also believes that his side have what it takes to take home maximum points. “The preparations are very good and I’m very happy because we have no serious injuries. I feel blessed because we are in good form. We are working very hard and we are trying to build a strong squad for the Hwange match. At this stage of the season, we are now focusing mostly on the team fitness and we are very happy with what we have achieved so far,” he said Caps United collected three points against Mushowani Stars on Sunday following a 3-2 win and they were the first to admit that they could have played better in that match. “This is the nature of sport and you can’t get all three points every match. Our last match was a good game. The team didn’t play beautiful football, but what is important is to gain the crucial three points and I’m happy we collected those points. I know we started a bit slow and we were a bit jaded, but our response was very good,” Chitembwe said. He noted that Hwange have been playing good football. “The game against Hwange will be difficult. Hwange have good players. They have done some serious work and they seem to be a solid team defensively and they are scoring goals,” the Caps United mentor said.
