BY TERRY MADYAUTA FC PLATINUM gaffer Norman Mapeza was relieved after his side bounced back to winning ways at the weekend following a rare win over ZPC Kariba. In the two matches preceding the weekend encounter, the reigning champions were held by Herentals before losing to TelOne which had thrust Mapeza and his team under pressure. As they attempt to defend their title, the platinum miners will also be participating in the 2019/2020 Caf Champions League commencing in August. However, after the weekend’s round of fixtures, Mapeza heaved a sigh of relief even though his side remain behind the early pacesetters Caps United and Chicken on 19 and 18 points respectively. Following the win over ZPC Kariba, who have previously been a difficult team for them to beat, Mapeza admitted that there was significant pressure on his side. “I am happy to have won this encounter after a rough patch along the way, but there is always pressure in football,” Mapeza. “Pressure will be there from day one until the last day of the season. So, we are here and we are well aware of the pressure which comes in this industry, but that doesn’t mean we have to succumb to it and let points go without a fight. “We wanted a response from the boys and, for us, this is massive and I will give it to the boys for working hard with high hopes that we maintain this work ethic.” The miners now occupy third position with 17 points and will be hoping to continue winning when they travel to the capital next weekend for a date with Yadah Stars.
