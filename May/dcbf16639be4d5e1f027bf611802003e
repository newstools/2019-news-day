BY DUDUZILE NDLUKULWANI BULAWAYO City Council is only left with a fleet of nine ambulances out of the required 21, compromising health delivery in the city, the latest council minutes have shown. Councillor Silas Chigora said an ambulance was required for each of the council’s  21 clinics, but the available ambulances were unable to meet demand. “A total of 21 ambulances would, therefore, be required. With the current financial challenges, this was not feasible. Currently, the city has only nine operational ambulances. Operation Florian had recently donated two ambulances and this has been appreciated,” Chigora said. Councillor Frank Javangwe said council clinics were charging Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) $5 yet there was no medication. Councillor Donaldson Mabutho was in support of the proposal by residents that   each clinic be allocated an ambulance. “The RTGS$5 paid by the residents was a consultation fee and with adequate funding, council would be able to provide medication,” Mabutho said.
