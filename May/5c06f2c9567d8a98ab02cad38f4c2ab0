BY KENNETH NYANGANI THE stage is now set for the Cyclone Idai Cheer Up and Reach Out Gala slated for Chipinge tomorrow with musicians, who include Leonard Zhakata, Lady Squanda, Larry Gunda and Sniper Storm, set to perform. The gala, bankrolled by Life Brand Agricultural Services, is expected to attract thousands of villagers. Life Brand Agric Services chief operations officer, Israel Kembo, confirmed the gala. “We operate within the community and we feel that the people of Chipinge and Chimanimani can also benefit from our existence. On May 17, 2019 we will host a Cyclone Idai Cheer Up and Reach Out Gala in Chipinge town,” he said in a statement. Kembo said the company will also sponsor 10 families affected by the devastating cyclone in Chipinge and Chimanimani with castor bean input packs worth US$5 600. “Castor bean is an export crop and we believe that its adoption by the beneficiaries will put them on a better financial position once they harvest, four months after planting,” he said. “Inasmuch as the devastation of Cyclone Idai will remain engraved in the hearts of the victims, cheering them up and giving them hope is key, especially in the aftermath.” Kembo said food and beverages will also be provided during the gala, which he added will go a long way in unifying the community and giving them back hope. “Generally, music being therapeutic, this noble gesture will come as a timely boost to revellers who have been starved of entertainment and hopefully get people to focus on brighter prospects to come in the future,” he said.
