BY WINSTONE ANTONIO OVER 150 visual upcoming and seasoned artists across the country are set to showcase their artworks at this year’s edition of the Wild Geese Art Fest. The festival will be held on Sunday at Wild Geese Lodge in Harare. Festival co-ordinator Leslie Johnson told NewsDay Life & Style that preparations for the arts fete were at an advanced stage. “Wild Geese Art Fest gives artists a chance to interact with the public and make their own sales as they display their work in a 3x3m space and man their own stand,” she said. “Each year, we support two charities. Our charities are The Vimba Project, who are assisting with the rebuilding of a school destroyed by Cyclone Idai and The Friend Animal Foundation who provide sanctuary to domestic animals.” Apart from the exhibition, Johnson said there would be live music, a painting exhibition, delicious food and an art competition, where 16 artists will compete to paint in 15 minutes in the presence of the patrons. Johnson said the festival has grown each year, with more than 8 000 people gracing the event last year and US$80 000 worth of artwork sold. Among the artists that will exhibit at the event are Liberty Shuro, Daryl Nero, Keith Zenda, Marlene Bornman, John Kotze, Barry Lungu and Cosmas Shiridzinomwa.
