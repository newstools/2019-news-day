BY DEMETRIA MANYONGA THE second edition of Nhaka Yehupenyu Benefit concert will be held on June 1, at Longcheng Plaza in Harare, with performances from several artistes drawn from diverse music genres expected. The musicians include Leonard Mapfumo, Snipper Storm, Sani Makhalima, Good Child, Tererai Mugwadi, Madiz, BaShupi, Nyasha David, Roki, Nesto and Pauline Gundidza. Mapfumo told NewsDay Life & Style that he came up with the idea after he was inspired by the work at Inspiration of Hope orphanage, where he is the board vice-president. The urban groover said this year’s beneficiary was a bridging school in Mbare, where he would provide the orphans with stationery. “The bridging school helps orphans and families that have children who cannot afford to pay school fees,” he said. “It helps 300 children from Grade 1 to Grade 7, but they face challenges, which range from Grade 7 (examination) registration fees to writing their final exams.” Mapfumo said this year’s edition was slightly different from last year’s, as they would have more artistes this year. “This year’s edition is already showing differences in that we have big players partnering us as well as new artistes coming in. We have already started to get donations,” he said. The Maidei hitmaker said the performers were his long-time friends who were passionate about the issue. Any other artiste was welcome to perform on the day, he said. “Most people performing on the day are some of my friends that I have worked with for over 18 years, and they are passionate about the issue, so it wasn’t hard for them to come on board, with some appreciating the need to educate the children. They said they would love to support the initiative, so any artiste is welcome to perform on that day,” Mapfumo said.
