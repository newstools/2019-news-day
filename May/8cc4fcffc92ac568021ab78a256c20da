LIFE & STYLE REPORTER ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Winky D scooped the Artiste of the Year Award and the Entrepreneurial Entertainment Business Leadership Excellence of the Year award, while his manager Jonathan Banda clinched the Manager of the Year award (Arts and Entertainment Leadership Excellence) during the Zimbabwe Business Awards (ZIBA) held at the weekend. Banda described the recognition as an acknowledgment by the business community of the good work they were doing. “It’s a great recognition because the arts operate in the context of business. It’s quite a great acknowledgment you rarely get from business entities,” he said. Winky D described the award as a cure for the despair associated with his work. “When the burden of the long, straight and narrow paths l walked on fatigued me, shoulders of institutions like Zimbabwe Business Awards got me and took over to cure the despair,” he posted on his Facebook page. “I wish to be the candle that will continue to burn itself out to grant vision and light onto the paths of others.” He expressed gratitude to ZIBA for the recognition and acknowledged his fans for the support. “I will continue to hold on to you with both hands,” he said. Winky D’s stock on the local music market has been growing, and he has won the hearts of several corporates and featured on their adverts as well as campaigns for different organisations. His music, which speaks to the struggles of young people in the country’s high-density suburbs, has seen his popularity rankings growing.
