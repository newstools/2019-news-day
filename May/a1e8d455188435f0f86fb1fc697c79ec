BY SHARON SIBINDI GATEWAY Zimbabwe is set to host the inaugural Harvest Festival this year at the Harare Gardens on May 4. The event is aimed at honouring the spirit of Ubuntu or Hunhu by celebrating and reinforcing ways that communities solve their challenges daily. Running under the theme: It’s Us and It’s Now: Whatever the Question-Community is the Answer, the festival will feature live music, storytelling, dance, art, slam poetry and theatre at the Main Stage arena. The festival also seeks to bring together Zimbabweans from all walks of life so that they celebrate diversity and resilience as a people and contribute towards reweaving the social fabric of Zimbabwe and building healthy communities. Kufunda Village founder Marianne Knuth who are leading the work of Gateway Zimbabwe, said the festival will help strengthen the social cohesion of Zimbabwean citizens. “As Gateway Zimbabwe, we have spent the past year experimenting with different ways of reweaving and enlivening the social fabric of Zimbabwe. Now, we are calling people back together who have been part of the journey, to look back and see what we are learning about building strong and healthy communities,” Knuth said. TrustAfrica country director Briggs Bomba said the community should come together and be the solution for Zimbabwe. “The health of our communities lies in our own agency as citizens. We cannot expect anyone to fix our communities. It is our responsibility,” he said. Gateway Zimbabwe is a collaborative initiative of Kufunda Village, ORAP and TrustAfrica who have been brought together by a concern for the fragmentation in the country and a commitment to reweave the social fabric of Zimbabwe. The event will see award-winning afro-fusion, mbira sensation Hope Masike,  afro-jazz singer Edith WeUtonga, Vernac hip-hop artist Hombakadzi,  Zimdancehall chanters Dhadza D and Guspy Warrior, hip-hop artiste LiveSoul and Beatboxing maestro Pro Beats, Djembe Monks, Arcane and Berina Arts taking part.
