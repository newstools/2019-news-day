Guest Column: Tapiwa Shumba This is an opinion clarifying the court order in the High Court Judgment on Advocate Nelson Chamisa’s Presidency. Now go and do it. Presumably, the court makes this order because there is nothing on court record that tells the court that the MDC has already called such a congress. Remember, although the judgment was delivered in May, this is a matter decided on applicants’ heads of argument filed on November 19, 2018 and respondents’ heads filed in January 2019 — before the MDC had convened the congress. On this point, we must understand that the court decides on court papers before it, and not from newspapers. The MDC constitution does not say the Extra-ordinary congress notice must state that it is extra-ordinary and not congress. The timing is enough to determine whether it is extra-ordinary or not. The constitution itself refers to the extra-ordinary congress as just congress, in some instances.
