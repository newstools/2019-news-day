BY Sports Reporter Zimbabwe womenâ€™s national cricket team opening batter Sharne Meyers, hit her second half century in as many matches as the hosts perfected their record in the International Cricket Council T-20 World Cup Africa Region Group A qualifier by beating Tanzania by 92 runs at Takashinga yesterday. Zimbabwe made 143 for 4 from 20 overs, while Tanzania only managed 51 for 8 in 20 overs. With the win Zimbabwe opened a two-point cushion at the top of the Group A while Rwanda and Nigeria both have two points. In the clash between Nigeria and Mozambique, the former emerged victorious by eight wickets after winning the toss before restricting the latter to 93 for 7 in 20 overs. Nigeria then reached their target with eight balls remaining after only two wickets tumbled in their innings. Meyers followed up on her 62 runs total against Mozambique on Sunday to smash 65 off 50 balls, a total that featured eight fours and two maximums. She fell to the bowling of 17-year-old Perice Mamunya, caught Tabu Omary to follow Modester Mupachikwa (30) and Precious Mugeri who made 15 runs. Captain Mary-Anne Musonda scored 19 runs while Josephine Nkomo and Anesu Mushangwe were on eight and one not out, respectively. On the bowling front, Tasmin Granger, Mushangwe and Audrey Mazvishaya shared six wickets equally while Nkomo had one.
