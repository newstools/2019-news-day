BY SINDISO DUBE BULAWAYO supermodel Natasha Carol Gora — who clinched the Miss Personality title during the 2018 edition of Miss Tourism Bulawayo — yesterday said she was excited to be Cosmopolitan Nightclub’s new brand ambassador. The 21-year-old beauty was voted the face of Cosmopolitan last month after shrugging off stiff competition from 19 other contestants. She will serve as the upmarket nightspot’s brand ambassador for a year. “I am enjoying every moment as face of Cosmo. I have met a number of influential people, celebrities and socialites. Most, importantly, it’s another special role I am playing both to the advantage of my career and the night club,” she said. “I am working with the club’s management to maintain the image of the upmarket nightclub and at the same time, I am looking forward to using the recent title to grow my brand as a model.” Gora expressed confidence that by the time she would hand over the crown, she would have amassed more skills and opportunities. The supermodel said she was currently studying towards a Diploma in TV and Film Production at the College of Creative Arts in Bulawayo, an affiliate of the Midlands State University, saying she harboured ambitions of becoming a full time actress. She described herself as “an all-rounder” who did pageants, fashion shows and advertising. Meanwhile, the DJ Tira fever has gripped Bulawayo ahead of his show dubbed One Night in Durban with DJ Tira at Cosmopolitan on Friday. The Durban’s finest artist’s gig comes just after another high-profile show with Prince Kaybee last month.
