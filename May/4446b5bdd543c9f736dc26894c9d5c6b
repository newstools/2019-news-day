BY SHARON SIBINDI AFTER making waves last year with songs featuring award-winning Bulawayo hip-hop sensation POY, Tapiwa ‘Six Oh’ Matarise has returned with a thrilling hip-hop track, Matanga, featuring rapper Stunner. The track was produced by Fish F Mcswag, with Gaddiel Maps of Memory Lane Studios shooting the video. “This is my first track this year, and this is just the beginning of greater things lined up this year. The track is focused on people who talk or spread rumours about people and judging others, thus the title Matanga,” Six Oh said. The musician said the track was released on Friday on SkyzMetro FM, adding the response so far has been overwhelming. “The track was released on Friday night at Skyz Metro FM during the 16 Bars radio show with Khekhe. The response so far is amazing and people really love the track. Soon, I will be doing a concert titled The Oh Effect, deriving from my name Six Oh,” he said. “I will be bringing Stunner to the city on May 25 at Club Hashtag. POY will also be performing on the day and hopefully, this should help market both me and the song.” Six Oh said he had learnt a lot from Stunner and that would help push his music career. “Working with Stunner was great, I learnt a lot and he is very real. He doesn’t sugar-coat anything. He is straight to the point. I feel that’s what made us click. He is real and doesn’t pretend to be humble. Above all, Stunner doesn’t change himself to try and please anyone,” he added.
