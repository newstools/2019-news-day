BY TERRY MADYAUTA Central Region Soccer League log leaders side Sheasham finally met their match when they were handed their first defeat of the season by WhaWha at the weekend. Few had given WhaWha a chance in the build-up to the encounter, but the Luke Petros-coached side gave John Nyikadzino and his lieutenants a rude awakening after stunning them 1-0 in their own backyard, Mkoba Stadium. Despite the dent, Sheasham remained at the summit of the log with 19 points while WhaWha  propelled to fourth position  with 14 points on their tally. Sheasham have a three points cushion over closest rivals ZPC Munyati, who have reinvented themselves from a laughing stock into a fierce force following an awful start to their season. The power utility side settled for a share of the spoils with MSU on Saturday. In other matches played at the weekend, third-placed FC Platinum U-19 were held to a goalless draw by minnows Kwekwe United, who remain winless at the bottom of the log table.

Vumbachikwe also registered a 2-1 win over newcomers Real BVM, while the other newbies Filabusi and The Venue FC played a goalless draw.
