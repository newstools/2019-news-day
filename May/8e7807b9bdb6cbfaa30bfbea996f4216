AN array of artists across genres will tomorrow converge and take turns to entertain patrons as they commemorate Africa Day through dance and music in Bulawayo’s Njube high-density suburb. BY SINDISO DUBE The event, which is a brainchild of Bruce Ncube of Mema Arts Zimbabwe and Derrick Tembo of Kaisa Arts, will feature at least 15 acts, among them Rapper Msizkay, Paula Paloma, Hwabaraty, a Mutare-based group Chenhaka arts, Mzoe 7, imbube group Indosakusa (formerly Impumelelo Shining Stars), Iyasa, Ezimnyama, Khaya Arts and Umkhathi theatre works. The event will bring together audiences to one of Bulawayo’s high-density suburbs in a traditional set up, and offer them an opportunity to interact with their favourite dancers. On the day, there will be performances, African food, arts and crafts stalls, including a workshop on how to make sanitary pads for young women. “When we started this event, it was after I sat down with Derrick with the thought of doing something big for the community of Njube. It is all about celebrating arts and culture and also bringing together celebrities in Bulawayo and their fans,” Ncube said. “Africa Day in Njube seeks to bridge that gap through bringing local artists to Njube. We are trying to bring everyone together to celebrate Ubuntu. Let’s interact in a friendly and joyful manner.” Ncube said being able to bring communities together through this event has been a big achievement for
them.
