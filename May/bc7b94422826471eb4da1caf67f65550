BY SHARON SIBINDI PREPARATIONS for the Friends in His Praises Encounter 2 Concert have begun and the event is expected to bring Christians together for a glorious afternoon of praise, during which Thembinkosi Nyoni will hold a live recording. Dubbed Friends in His Praises Encounter 2 – Special Africa Day, the May 25 concert will be held at the Rainbow Elite and will bring established and aspiring musicians together on stage.
Nyoni told Southern Eye Life & Style that preparations for the big day had begun. “We have started preparing for the big day and this time we started marketing the event early, unlike last time when we marketed it late. We organised most of the things on the very day and started late, but now we have started early in order to bring on up-to-standard concert,” he said. “Everyone is now geared to rock the city on the day with an interesting schedule. This will be a very special Africa Day as we Africans will be displaying our God-given talents through gospel music.” Nyoni said gospel lovers would this time have their thirst quenched as he had spiced his line-up with some very popular gospel artistes from the city. “It’s an afternoon of praise for Christians and non-Christians alike. We will be featuring mainly upcoming and seasoned artistes from this city, among them Bishop Lu, Paula Sarah, Audrey, Roby M, Felly N, Lady Erica, Sindiso Nkomo, Psalmist Maxwell Minister Ngoni. It’s an Africa Day event where African talent will be displayed,” he said. “The inspiration comes from the works of God in our lives, no matter the hardships, He keeps us going so He deserves our praises. We promise nothing, but the manifestation of hidden talent on the day. The city has a lot of talent that needs exposure and on the day it will be exposed to the world. We urge all to come and support the local talent and also the growth of gospel music.” Last year’s Encounter 1 featured artistes such as Oscar, Taliah, Siza, Lantong, Yolanda and the Gospel Maniacs.
