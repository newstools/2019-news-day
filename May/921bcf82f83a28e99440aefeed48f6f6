By Sindiso Dube As part of the celebrations of Bulawayo’s 125th anniversary, NewsDay, the Bulawayo City Council and First Mutual will today jointly host the debut Golf Day at the Bulawayo Gold Club with 17 sets participating. The City of Bulawayo on June 1 celebrates 125 years since its establishment as an urban settlement with the golf day being one of the many activities lined up to celebrate the feat. The 125th official anniversary celebrations have, however, been postponed from Saturday to June 4 because it has clashed with the  burial of the late national hero Dumiso Dabengwa. Bulawayo was declared a town by Leander Starr Jameson on June 1, 1894 and subsequently attained city status in 1943. The city also had its first advisory board in 1894. Alpha Media Holdings (the publishers of NewsDay, The Standard, Zimbabwe Independent) events co-ordinator Anqobile Sitsha confirmed that the event had since attracted at least 17 teams.
“The event is starting at 11am. We have 17 contestants who have confirmed their participation and we expect more to come through on the day,” she said. “Golf provides a conducive environment to socialise, hence businesses should take part and make use of the platform to create and strengthen contacts. We shall also host a cocktail for all our participants in the evening which will offer a mixing and mingling platform.” The event is the first of its kind in Bulawayo and the organisers are looking forward to having such events in the future.
