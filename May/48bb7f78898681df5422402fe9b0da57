BY TERRY MADYAUTA FC PLATINUM Under-19 surged to the summit of the Zifa Central Region Soccer League for the first time this season following a narrow 1-0 win over struggling Black Eagles at Maglas Stadium on Sunday. They have collected 14 points out of a possible 18 and are one point ahead of second-placed Sheasham. Sheasham were dislodged from the top post after they drew two-all against Ivan Hoe Mine FC. But the John Nyikadzino-coached side have an opportunity to reclaim top spot tomorrow afternoon when they fulfill their game in hand against troubled Black Eagles at Buchwa in Mberengwa. In other fixtures, MSU FC kept momentum after they collected maximum points away to Filabusi winning 2-0, leaping to third position with 11 points on their tally. Meanwhile, seasoned campaigners WhaWha appeared to be slowly turning the hands of time back to their glory days. Chekera Pasi as they are fondly known claimed their second win on the trot as they shredded Vumbachikwe 3-1. Shurugwi Real BVM, who were dismal in their first five games, finally collected their first set of maximum points following a 3-0 drubbing of Mapisa-based Venue FC. However, it remains a sorry story for Zvishavane giants Shabanie Mine whose hopes of bouncing back into the Premier Soccer League continue to fade by each game. The Ikabort Masocha-coached side fell 2-0 at the hands of ZPC Munyati. Similarly, former Triple B gaffer Peter Manoti is having a rough ride at the helm of Kwekwe United, who lost 3-1 at the hands of Beitbridge side Dulivhadzimo.
