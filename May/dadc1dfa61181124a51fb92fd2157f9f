BY Sports Reporter Zimbabwe’s star boxer Charles Manyuchi displayed a devastating performance to be crowned the UBC & GBU Intercontinental Super Welterweight champion after defeating Argentinian opponent Pablo Acosta who threw in the towel in the fifth round in the early hours of Sunday morning. Acosta never looked like giving any challenge as he was floored several times by Manyuchi’s precise punches. Manyuchi looked composed, but also in a hurry to finish the fight in quick time as he went on the attack from the start and never relented. Acosta complained on occasion that he had been hit below the belt and that Manyuchi was using dirty tactics. Once the visitor started to look frustrated and also jaded from the relentless punching by the former WBC Welterweight Silver champion, Manyuchi increased the intensity to try and get over with it in quick time. The small, but appreciative crowd enjoyed every minute of this bout that came after interesting international fights that were full of entertainment. Manyuchi was watched by among others football legend Peter Ndlovu as well as Information deputy minister Energy Mutodi. The fight was dubbed the Restoration Fight as Manyuchi seeks to climb back up the ladder to get back to the top of his division. He announced after Sunday morning’s fight that his next challenge will be in Tunisia on August 3. Manyuchi, however, seems to have fallen out with his former management Oriental Quarry of Zambia as the former representatives were conspicuous by their absence.
