By Simbarashe Sithole A BINDURA-BASED gold panner was allegedly recently assaulted to death by over 80 artisanal miners at Mazowe Mine after he, together with two colleagues, secretly entered into one of the shafts believed to be rich in gold ore. The two other miners escaped with serious injuries. Peter Nyamazani (31) died after he was severely attacked by the mob before being stabbed by one of his assailants in the head. Mashonaland Central police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Petros Masikati confirmed the incident. “We are investigating a murder case in Mazowe, where over 80 gold panners pounced on their three colleagues, who they assaulted with switches. Two of the miners, Tatenda Nyamazana (24) and Silvester Imbayarwo (30), managed to escape with injuries, while one died on the spot,” he said. “One of the panners reportedly pulled a knife and stabbed the now-deceased in the head. After committing the crime, they all fled from the scene.” In a related case, police in Mashonaland Central have launched a manhunt for a murder suspect, popularly known as Igwe in the mining circles, who allegedly killed Nathana Katsangaya (29) at Mazowe Mine on April 27, after he reportedly demanded his debt. Masikati told NewsDay that the suspect assaulted the deceased with a log and he subsequently died at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals a day after the alleged assault. “We have launched a manhunt for the suspect called Igwe in the mining circles, who reportedly killed Katasangaya after he demanded his $22 from the suspect. Igwe became violent and assaulted the deceased with a log until he became unconscious. He was rushed to Concession Hospital and later transferred to Parirenyatwa Hospital, where he eventually died,” he said. Masikati urged people to desist from engaging in illegal mining. “These activities are claiming many lives. People no longer respect the sanctity of life. So, as police, we urge people not to attempt to join illegal mining,” he said.
