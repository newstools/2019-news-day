MASVINGO Teachers’ College music lecturer Phineas Magwati, in partnership with the National Traditional Dancers Association and Dzimbadzamabwe Music Arts Centre (Dimac), is set to host the Zimbabwe Multi-cultural Arts Festival tomorrow at the Dzimbadzamabwe Cultural Village. BY ADMIRE JAMU-MLAMBO The festival is expected to bring together different people from across the divide to showcase their various abilities in traditional dances like shangara, mbakumba, muchongoyo and mbende. “Yes, it is in line with the culture week celebrations and our major objective is to create a platform for culture exchange, as well as to forge ahead with empowering societies so that they engage in cultural entrepreneurship,” he said. Magwati said the festival, which coincides with the Zimbabwe Culture Week, was an effective way of empowering rural communities and make them institutionalise their cultural heritage for economic capital. The multi-cultural festival is set to be graced by 23 groups, including two secondary and eight primary schools, among them Chipindura Primary who were the 2018 Jikinya Dance Festival champions and the 2017 winners, Gaba Primary School, will also grace the occassion. Three teacher colleges — Bondolfi, Morgan Zintec and Masvingo — including Great Zimbabwe University’s Dare Rimwe and several other arts groups will also showcase their talents. The music lecturer, who is also a researcher, is expected to bring with him the Masvingo Teachers’ College dance group. The gate  charges will be ZWL$3 for children and ZWL$5 for adults, respectively.
