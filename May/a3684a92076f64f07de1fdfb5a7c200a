BY CRAIG MOYO FINGERS Academy modelling graduates Shawn Mutasa and Ashley Sibanda are set to launch their clothing brand next month in an effort to create opportunities for themselves in the fashion and media industry. Mutasa and Sibanda, who are both aged 20, have named their brand Jacobean Apparel, to cater for both women and men. The duo told Southern Eye Life & Style that the new clothing brand was yet to penetrate the market. “The designs we have created for our clothing brand are impressive. There is no doubt that creativity has no limits. We do have Coco Chanel, Tom Ford, Valentio Clemente and Ludovico Garavani as our role models and inspiration,” Sibanda said. Sibanda said their dream was to eventually venture into other branches of fashion, including shoes and tracksuits. Mutasa urged designers to always come up with fresh products in order to lure people into buying local products, as a number of people were buying clothing items outside the country. “As designers, we need to stay competitive, bringing in new products. We should be able to produce products that are good enough to cost a fortune and be able to provoke emotions, as emotion is a powerful tool in the marketing industry,” he said. “We need to make our products appeal to our clients so that we stay relevant and even take over the market, largely dominated by international brands.” With the clothing market in Zimbabwe largely flooded by Chinese boutiques, the designers said their strategy was to sell their products mainly on social media platforms.
