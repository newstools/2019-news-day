BY MOSES MUGUGUNYEKI POPULAR Harare preacher Prophet Tapiwa Freddy yesterday dropped a video of his single track titled Chikuru Kudzoka which features musician Baba Harare and comedian Samatha “Gonyeti” Kureya. The single is a precursor to the musician-cum preacher’s fourth album titled Kastep Kenyasha to be released on July 5 in Harare. Freddy has released three quality videos in the last five months. “Music is my other side of life, especially when I am not on the pulpit. It is one way of serving the Lord,” he said. Fredy said he was once into drama and theatre, hence his videos are laced with comedy. “I try to send the message of the Lord through humour as in my videos of the songs Chikuru Kudzoka and Tinopembera,” he said. The video of the single Chikuru Kudzoka is already making waves on social media platforms, including YouTube. “Gonyeti is a popular comedian and Baba Harare is doing excellent work on videos, so l roped them in to give impetus to the product,” he said. Freddy said he was now finalising work on his forthcoming album. “My forthcoming album, which features gospel artistes Mathias Mhere, Bethen Pasinawako — Ngolomi, Kudzi Nyakudya and Baba Harare, is almost done and we will launch it on July 5 in Avondale, ” he said. Early this year P Freddy dropped two videos of the songs Vana and Tinopembera, off his 2016 album 100 Percent Prophetic. The cleric has been involved in music since 2002. His other previous releases include Mesiya (2002), Serevende (2006) and 100 Percent Prophetic (2016).
