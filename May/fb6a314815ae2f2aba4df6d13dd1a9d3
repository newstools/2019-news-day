BY TERRY MADYAUTA FC PLATINUM midfield enforcer Farai Edwin Madhanhanga (24) has been invited for trials at South African Premiership side Bidvest Wits. The Gavin Hunt-coached side was charmed by Madhanhanga who helped FC Platinum claim their second Premier Soccer League title last year. The gritty midfielder was also a shining star for the platinum miners when they reached the group stage of the 2018/19 CAF Champions League for the first time in three attempts. The 2018 Soccer Star of the Year finalist initially ignored several offers from a number of foreign clubs but found the Bidvest call too sweet to snub. And after helping the Norman Mapeza-coached side reach the inter-club competition group stages, he is now ready to move. Addressing a Press conference in Zvishavane, Mapeza revealed that they will miss the boisterous presence of Madhanhanga when they take on Herentals on Saturday as he is in South Africa on a trial stint at Bidvest. “We have set objectives as a team, as coaches, as players. Some want to go outside the country to play there. “We also have some who want to try their luck and play for the Warriors in Egypt so that is the motivation here. “I am happy to be helping these boys, for example Madhanhanga is not here today because he was invited to Bidvest Wits for trials and we wish him the best. That is a motivation to us as a team,” he said. Bidvest Wits is also home to former Ngezi Platinum forward Terrence Dzvukamanja who joined last year. Madhanhanga could become the latest FC Platinum player to join the South African bandwagon following the footsteps of Gerald Takwara who joined Ajax Cape Town at the end of 2017 and Rodwell Chinyengetere who signed for Baroka FC earlier this year. Thabani Kamusoko and Donald Ngoma are also some of the FC Platinum exports, now plying their trade in Tanzania. Winston Mhango moved from FC Platinum to ply his trade at Kabwe Warriors in the Zambian Super League.
