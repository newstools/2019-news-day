BY JAMES MUONWA INTERNATIONALLY-ACCLAIMED visual artist Raphael Jamu will this weekend hold a solo exhibition and auction of portraits of former presidents of African countries at the Rainbow Towers Hotel under the theme, Art in the Making Project. Jamu said the exhibition was the brainchild of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ambassador and dean of African diplomats, Mwanampanga Mwanananga. Each portrait will be sold for $1 500. The artist has so far done portraits of former presidents Robert Mugabe and slain DRC leader Laurent Kabila. Meanwhile, Jamu is next month set to travel to Europe to receive an award for his prolific artworks. “After this upcoming art exhibition I will be travelling to Europe at Galway Gallery in Ireland for my award which I won ahead of 12 other artists from across the world,” he said. Jamu will also tour Birmingham before travelling to Munich in Germany before going to Wales for art exchange programmes. “I look forward to benefit immensely from the exchange of art ideas with other artists,” he said.
