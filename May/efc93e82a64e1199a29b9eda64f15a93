By Freeman Makopa Zimbabwe’s top junior rowers made their presence felt over the weekend in the finals of the South African senior championships held at Roodeplaat Dam in Pretoria, winning two gold and one bronze. Rowing Association of Zimbabwe coach Kristine Johnson was pleased with the success. “We had a successful regatta last weekend at the South African National Championships,” she said. “Our top performers were Rory and Patrick Plunket racing in the men’s doubles event, being placed first and winning gold. The pair trains in South Africa at Hilton College under coach Ernie Steenkamp. “Congratulations to our young Rowers. They put in a lot of work to be where they are.  It is clearly paying off with the great results.” Lorryn Bass was placed eighth in the women’s singles event, where all her competitors train in the South African U-23 and open squad. Savannah Hendrickse came in third behind Bass, collecting her Bronze medal in the J18 Girls event. Michael Hadingham gave commanding performances in the men’s B singles event and the men’s lightweight. In both events, he raced against university rowers and adults, finishing fifth. Meanwhile, Rory and Patrick are all aiming to compete at Junior Worlds in Tokyo, Japan, later this year.
