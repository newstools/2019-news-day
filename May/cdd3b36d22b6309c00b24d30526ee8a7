BY MUNYARADZI MADZOKERE ARMY side Black Rhinos will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing loss to newcomers Mushowani Stars over the weekend when they take on bottom side Bulawayo Chiefs in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League encounter at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. Chiefs are in high spirits after recording their first point of the season, albeit through hook and crook, in a goalless draw against Harare City over the weekend. Black Rhinos have had a sluggish start to the 2019 season and are still smarting from a 2-0 defeat at the hands of debutants Mushowani in their last encounter. The army side find themselves in 11th place on the log standings with eight points from six matches, but have a game in hand. However, a win for the Herbert Maruwa-coached side, their third of the season, could see them climb as high as seventh on the league ladder. But they can underrate chiefs at their own peril. Chiefs exhibited such resolve to earn a share of the spoils against Harare City, fusing brilliant defending with matchless delaying tactics to frustrate their opponents a few days back. With a defence that has shipped in 14 goals in six matches, Bulawayo Chiefs are likely to employ the same tactics against a Rhinos side that looks strong on paper.
