ASM, which already has bright Zimbabwean rugby prospects Cleopas Kundiona and Kudakwashe Nyakufaringwa as clients, has secured a sponsorship package for the UBC & GBU Intercontinental Super Welterweight title fight at Harare International Conference Centre on May 25. The clash has been dubbed “the restoration fight.” Local car dealer TinMac Motors has been brought in by ASM as one of the fight sponsors. ASM chief executive Glorianne Francis, who flew from the United Kingdom to run the show, said the growing sports agency did not hesitate to partner with Manyuchi. “ASM has signed up our champion and national boxing icon to help manage his brand, create endorsement opportunities and facilitate the right structures  to afford our champion to enjoy his boxing again through this comeback fight,” Francis said. “At present, we are still reaching out to all key stakeholders to be involved and play a part in making this day a success. All associate partners for the event are putting in the work, day-in-and-out, working together as Team Zimbabwe and mostly Team Manyuchi. It’s an exciting time.” Francis, who has previously done some promotional work with American Evander Holyfield, the former professional boxer, said her agency has lined up more exciting athletes and events in future. “ASM is growing and advancing each day and we look forward to be involved in some quality work and projects, internationally and locally.” Manyuchi (29), a former World Boxing Council (WBC) Silver Welterweight Champion Manyuchi has been battling to revive his career since losing his coveted title to Qudratillo Abduqaxorov of Uzbekistan in Singapore two years ago. The boxer lost his last big fight to Russian Magomed Kurbanov in August last year and will be determined to make the most of his latest opportunity in the upcoming bout against Acosta.
