BY TERRY MADYAUTA CENTRAL Region Soccer League championship favourites, Sheasham, remained at the apex of the log despite being held to a goalless draw by Ivan Hoe at the weekend. The Gweru-based side have 48 points, two ahead of their closest rivals ZPC Munyati and MSU FC, who have 46 points apiece. Gwanda-based Vumbachikwe are fourth with 45 points on their tally, having been blowing hot and cold since the start of the seasonâ€™s second half. They lost 1-0 to fifth-placed Whawha, who also fancy their chances of winning the sole ticket to the topflight. However, Luke Petros, who is in charge of the prison wardens was first to admit that winning promotion will be a tough task. In the other matches played at the weekend, FC Platinum U-19 triumphed 3-0 over troubled Black Eagles, while the Venue shared spoils with Real BVM following a goalless draw. Blanket Mine and Dendairy drew 1-1, a result that saw the latter dropping to tenth position. Struggling Shabanie Mine held ZPC Munyati 1-1, while Gokwe North and ZRP Gweru shared spoils in a thrilling 2-2 draw. The three teams promoted at the start of the season, Kwekwe United, Venue and ZRP Gweru are entangled in a relegation dogfight together with Black Eagles.
