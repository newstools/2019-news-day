They also drew the third match. Kavazovic has been appointed ahead of today’s game against Tafic at Lobatse Stadium. Tafic is coached by Zimbabwean Saul Chaminuka. Kavazovic is not new to the Botswana Premier League, having won the championship in the 2017-2018 with Township Rollers, the first Botswana side to qualify for the Caf Champions League group stages. Township Rollers also clinched the Mascom Top 8 Cup that season and quit the champions in October last year.
