Ralph Kawondera’s first half strike was all the Taurai Mangwiro-coached side needed for them to take victory and put one foot into the next stage as they now only need to avoid defeat at home for them to qualify. The Tongaat Hulett-sponsored side emulated FC Platinum, who beat Mozambique side UD Songo 1-0 in a Caf Champions League match at Barbourfields Stadium on Saturday. Triangle will be looking to finish off the job at home and qualify for the group stages of the competition, where they will be guaranteed US$275 000. They will be looking to go all the way and claim the main prize of a trophy and US$1,5 million. Local clubs have not enjoyed much success in this competition and Triangle are looking to hold their own in the continent’s second-tier club tournament.
