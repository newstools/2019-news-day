BY TERRY MADYAUTA TELONE have appointed Lloyd Mutasa as Rahman Gumbo’s assistant coach as the Gweru-based side fights to escape relegation from the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. Tembo Chuma has also been roped in as goalkeepers’ coach as the club finalised an overhaul of its technical team, a move necessitated by a spate of poor results and the threat of losing topflight status. Mutasa, was selected ahead of Agent Sawu, Elvis Chiweshe, while the former Highlanders goalkeepers’ coach, Chuma shrugged off competition from his former teammate Peter Nkomo. Mutasa has been unattached since he was dismissed as Dynamos head coach last year, but he comes in with a lot of coaching experience having presided over WhaWha and the now defunct Kiglon. The former Dynamos midfielder worked with Gumbo at the national team where they were both assistants to Sunday Chidzambga in both the qualifying phase and the finals of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Club president Lloyd Mtetwa confirmed the development. “We have engaged Lloyd Mutasa and Tembo Chuma as first assistant coach and goalkeepers’ coach, respectively,” Mtetwa said. The pair officially commenced their duties yesterday. Mutasa had his first training session with the club at Midlands Christian College grounds, while Chuma is set to join today. Their appointment comes ahead of  a tough test away to defending Premier Soccer League champions FC Platinum. Ironically, Gumbo and Mutasa both coached the Zvishavane side in 2011 and 2013, respectively. They will be hoping to collect maximum points against their former paymasters and continue their climb from the relegation zone.
