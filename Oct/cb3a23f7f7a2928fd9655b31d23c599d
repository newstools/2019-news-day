UPCOMING music artiste Nyasha “Arrowgent” Kwembeya is set to do a double launch of his debut 15-track album titled The Black Print online and at a local radio station on December 15 in Harare. BY CHELSEA MUSAFARE In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Kwembeya said preparations for his new offering were on course, adding that he was working hard to produce good stuff for his fans. “Music, through online stores and local stations, will enable both radio and television personalities and everyone involved to share and play the music on the same day. The tracks will be available on YouTube and it will also be launched on a local radio station,” he said. Kwembeya, who said the forthcoming production carries themes centred on social life and gospel, made his own beats and self-produced the album. “My music centres on life, love and the gospel. Music defines me. It makes me feel alive. My inspiration comes from the sounds I hear in my head. The moment that I create an instrument definitely the lines start pouring down on paper. Music is what keeps me going,” he said. Some of the songs on the album are: Port of H Town, Jamba, Mutsikei, Get Over It, Real Aint Real, Streets, Mr President, Life Yangu, Real Niggas, I Just Woke Up, Motivation, Imagine That, Chibhora, Let it Run and Mighty Saint. The musician said he was inspired by hip-hop sensation Takura’s music and he wished to collaborate with him.
