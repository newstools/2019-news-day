By Sports Reporter The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) will next month hold the second Rail Trail Annual Charity Half Marathon in Bulawayo. The marathon was launched last year and is now an annual feature on the Bulawayo athletics calendar. This year’s race will be held on November 3, with the starting and finishing point at Raylton Recreational Club. The marathon has four categories — the flagship 21km race, 10km, 5km and a 5km walk, which are open to all men, women and children, including wheelchair athletes.
Registration for the marathon is now open and can also be made online. The registration fees have been pegged at $50 for adults and $25 for children. A total of $33 000 has been set aside for prizes. The winner in the 21km races both male and female will each walk away with $3 500 while the prize money in the wheelchair categories is $1 500 for the top finishers.
In the 10km race, the winner will earn $1 000 each. Masters and Grand Masters, who finish first, will take home $500. Winners in the 5km walk will receive train tickets. Proceeds from the marathon will be used to cater for charity and community development purposes. Last year’s 21km senior men’s race was won by Tendayi Zimuto of Black Rhinos Athletics Club, while Rudo Mhonderwa of Power House Athletics Club came first in the senior women’s
category. The Rail Trail Annual Charity Half Marathon commemorates the arrival of the first train in Bulawayo on November 4, 1897.
