By Sports Reporter Warriors coach Joey Antipas has included Dynamos striker Evans Katema in his provisional squad for the African Nations Championships (Chan) qualifier against Lesotho on October 20. Katema has been out of action for some weeks, but is nearing a return to fitness as he is set to be assessed today to ascertain whether he can join full training at his club. Caps United midfielder Joel Ngodzo, who has been struggling to renew his passport, has also been called up. After the 3-1 first leg win over Lesotho last month, Antipas bemoaned the unavailability of a creative midfielder such as Ngodzo as the team put up a flat show characterised by long balls. Dynamos goalkeeper Simba Chinani joins Ariel Sibanda and Ngezi Platinum’s Nelson Chadya as the three goalkeepers to fight it out for the two travelling slots. The defence is unchanged, but in midfield Valentine Kadonzvo and Ngezi’s Donald Teguru have earned call-ups. Zimbabwe need to avoid a defeat by at least a two-goal margin for them to clinch their ticket to next year’s finals.
