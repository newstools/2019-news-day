BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO FASHION designer Rukudzo Sarupinda is set to represent the country at the inaugural African Women Designers Week themed Fashion and the Society that is scheduled for Maputo, Mozambique this weekend. The fashion showcase, which will start tomorrow and end on Saturday, was designed to create awareness on violence against African women and inclusion of women living with disabilities. Planning and logistics officer Amamihe Kaiser told NewsDay Life & Style that the fashion week will be hosted by Green Waves in partnership with Trans African Centre for Development Maputo and St Eve West Africa Fashion Week (Nigeria). “The main objective is to create awareness on the issue of violence suffered by African women in our societies with inclusion of women with different physical disabilities in African societies, using the role of African stylists and designers to promote this area through exchange of experiences, workshops, debate and exhibition,” Kaiser said. “This event will be attended by designers from various African countries, as well as artists from different cultural backgrounds and distinguished guests from African societies, culminating in the presentation of several collections brought by the designers, a cocktail gala dinner for interactional networking and awards.” Sarupinda, who was invited together with her personal assistant Vimbai Chiminya, said she was going to maximise on the opportunity. “I am going to utilise this great opportunity for the development of my career and the benefit of the local fashion industry. It will not be just a matter of showcasing my designs, but I intend to learn from fellow designers in Africa. I need to understand how they are coping in their respective countries,” she said. The Kuxy Creation label founder once participated at the Africa-London Fashion Week.
