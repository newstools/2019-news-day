ZPC KARIBA………….(0) DENVER Mukamba was on target as Chapungu bounced back to winning ways with a crushing win over ZPC Kariba at Ascot Stadium yesterday in a result that effectively ends the Kariba side’s ambitions to win the title this season. Ian Nyoni and Mukamba’s goals arrived in the first half to ensure maximum points for the airmen. The result was frustrating for the power generators who have now gone five games without a win. With the win, Chapungu moved three places to eighth position with 38 points while ZPC Kariba remained stagnant on forth position where they have 42 points on their tally. Chapungu coach Weddington Chinyan’anya was full of praise after his charges collected maximum points. “This is a massive result for us considering that we drew in our last three games because of our poor conversion rate.  And we have been working on our finishing which was our main problem of late but today I am happy that the boys were clinical in front of goals and we hope to build on that in our next assignment against Yadah Stars,” he said. His counterpart Godfrey Tamirepi was livid after the match. “We started the match very slow and conceded early. The home side was hungrier than us and in football if you are not hungry enough then you cannot win matches. Our defence line was also in shambles, the goals we conceded were very soft, especially in this kind of competition. I hope we are going to improve in the next matches though our hopes of winning the title have been dampened by this loss,” Tamirepi said.
