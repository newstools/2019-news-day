BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO THE search for Africa’s cultural ambassador is set to take place at the Zuri Africa-Global finals slated for November 1 in Harare as Zimbabwe plays host to 14 African countries including Zambia and South Africa. Zuri Africa-Global founder and director Ryan Nush told NewsDay Life & Style that the 14 countries have already chosen queens to represent them at the grand finale that seeks to promote organic cultures and investment in Africa. “Zimbabwe, which recently crowned Nomazulu Gumbo the 2019 queen, is set to host the inaugural Africa finals,” he said. Nush said Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Zambia, Togo, South Africa, Rwanda, Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Eswatini, Tanzania and Lesotho have officially confirmed their participation. “We need to give the visiting countries an amazing lifetime experience and at the same time it’s a platform for the countries to sell their organic cultures. Subsequently, this would promote investment on the continent as non-African countries get inspired to visit Africa. Most importantly, this will give Zimbabwe an opportunity to market itself,” he said, adding that Nigeria was going to host the second edition of the Africa finals in 2020. “Nigeria, which is being sponsored by Anambra State Government and got endorsed by the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, will host the Zuri Africa Global next year,” he said.
