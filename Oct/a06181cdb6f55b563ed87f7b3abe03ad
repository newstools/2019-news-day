By Freeman Makopa THE Zimbabwe amateur golf team left the country yesterday for the All Africa Golf Team Championship (AAGTC) in Mauritius. They will take part in the 72-hole tournament to be played over four days from tomorrow to Sunday. The team consists of the top four junior players in the country — Jack Allard, Graeme Lewis, Morton Kumbayi and Premise Sumbeiro. Zimbabwe Golf Association president Mufaro Chivonivoni said they were hoping to upset South Africa, who are the favourites. “We are happy that we have selected a strong team and they left the country on Monday,” he said. “Except for Jack Allard, who just finished his scholarship in the United States, some of them have not played on the international stage, but we are confident of their capabilities. “We are hoping that the team will upset South Africa, who are the powerhouse and also have been winning these championships for the past years, including last year. But we are confident of pulling a surprise.” Chivonivoni said they went through a rigorous selection process and they were pleased with the team that they had put together. “The team has been in training and we did not just pick up people, but we conducted a series of tournaments, which resulted in the selection of the players and they are looking forward to ending South Africa’s dominance,” he added.
