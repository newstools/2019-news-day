BY FREEMAN MAKOPA GERMAN pop musician Kilian Unger has roped in Afro-fusion songbird and mbira player Hope Masike into one of his songs titled Regen, off his forthcoming album. Masike, who is currently in Munich where she is working on her part of the song, told NewsDay Life & Style that she was asked to feature on the track after having worked with Unger in 2014. “My friend and fellow musician, Killian Unger, is finishing off his début album, so he invited me over to Munich to feature in one of his songs for this album, a song called Regen’, meaning rain. It’s a song celebrating rain after a drought,” she said. Masike said she first met Unger in 2014 while preparing for a German-Zimbabwean-Ugandan musical called Kuenda. The band also included Zimbabwe’s Probeatz and Ugandan Ronald Chibirige. “In the musical, we played together extensively. We all fused our different music influences and came up with a very funny mix.  I went on to further work with Killian for a BMW advert in a song called Pieces of My Heart. It has been a favourite of many over the last years,” she said. The mbira princess said networking opened up opportunities to do productions with top artistes from around the world. “Network is indeed network! So, start going out into your dream direction, start meeting and making useful friends… The world is yours for the taking,” she said. Masike urged young girls not to fear the world, but to explore opportunities as no one would bring the world to them. The musician has also taken part in a number of regional and international music festivals and projects, including being incorporated in the famed Mahube, a collection of top southern African musicians and vocalists years. She recently released her third album, Exorcism of a Spinster.
