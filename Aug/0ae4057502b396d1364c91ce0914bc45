By Simbarashe Sithole ONE illegal miner from Muzarabani fell into a mineshaft and died while running away from a rival gang  in a machete fight over gold at a disused mine in Mazowe last week. Tafadzwa Mutimbaire (age not given) of Mutasa village Chief Hwata, Muzarabani died after falling into a gold mineshaft while fleeing from a machete clash with a rival syndicate. Mashonaland Central police spokesperson Inspector Milton Mundembe confirmed the tragedy which happened last week. “I can confirm a sudden death case in Mazowe where an illegal miner fell into a shaft while running away from another syndicate that was attacking them in a
scuffle over gold,” Mundembe said. Allegations are that a group of 20 artisanal miners from Muzarabani, led by Justine Mutasa (36), entered a mine where they met a rival group of about 30
illegal miners led by a man only identified as Morden. Morden’s group demanded gold from Mutasa’s group while wielding machetes. The Mutasa-led syndicate fled in different directions and luck was not on the side of
the now deceased Mutimbaire who fell into a disused shaft. His body was retrieved by a Mazowe Mine rescue team and sent to Concession Hospital. In an unrelated case, a Madziwa man Crylive Nhata (23) of Maponga village died in a road accident yesterday while seven others were seriously injured after he
lost control of his vehicle before it veered off the road and hit a tree at the 107km peg along the Harare-Mukumbura Road.
