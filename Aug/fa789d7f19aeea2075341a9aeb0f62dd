BY PRECIOUS CHIDA YESTERYEAR kwaito star Sikhululekile “Skhu” Mpofu said the trauma of going through divorce just after giving birth kept her away from the limelight and nearly derailed her music career, but is now back with a new song. The 38-year-old crooner made waves at the turn of the millennium with the hits Hamba Nobani, featuring her brother Mbekezeli “PoZee” Mpofu, and Owami. “I had complications with the baby so I was in and out of hospital from birth until she was three. I later got divorced, which was a traumatic time for me,”
she told NewsDay Life & Style. Skhu said after the harrowing experience, she decided to turn to God, after which she released a gospel single, Sibusiso, last year. “Prayer was my source to get through the dark days, hence forgiveness was very easy for me. I then penned the song Sibusiso because as I look back, I can’t
believe the trauma that could have killed me actually made me to become a good person,” she said. Since breaking her sabbatical last year in gospel garb, Skhu said she had done several singles, among them Mama Wami and has established a music label Kas-no-
valo Entertainment with PoZee. Skhu said she is set to release a new album which will be different from her old music. “I will be releasing a new album which will definitely be something different from the Skhu people knew, but my feel will be heard. Times have changed and the
producers I will work with will help fuse the modern and old Skhu into something that the new generation will get to understand, love and appreciate,” she said.
