BY SINDISO DUBE AFTER launching her debut album dubbed Pamusoroi at the Jason Mphepo Little Theatre early this month, Masa Caroleen will now take her new project to the Okavongo Delta Festival on Rockston Island in Tsutsubega, Botswana. The annual fete will run from August 29 to September 1. The fiesta is meant to improve the economy of the rural and remote Tsutsubenga community. Masa will be joined by Bulawayo-based ensemble, Djembe Monks and Flying Bantu. Shantie Lo, Mpho Sebina and the Natives will make up the list of Botswana performers. Masa said she was looking forward to her debut Okavango Festival appearance as well as sharing her new album on a regional stage. “I am excited about the experience ahead of me and my band. It’s my first time there, and I foresee an exciting road trip and a great regional performance. I am promising the usual energy and vibe on stage and sharing my music
with people who don’t know a lot about us; that’s the power of music. There are no borders when it comes to it,” she said. She said the title of her album, Pamusoroi, was crafted in a cultural context where the word is used as a form of respect, like in requesting permission to speak among elders and asking someone to step aside so one can pass. Masa’s music journey started back in college in Bulawayo, where she taught herself to play the guitar. “I taught myself how to play musical instruments when I was in college in Bulawayo,” she said. She said her decision to come to Harare had opened up more opportunities, enabling her to reach out to fellow musician, Tariro neGitare. “When I came to Harare for work, I started attending Acoustic Nights organised by Tariro neGitare at Germany Society because I needed something to do after work, then going to the Book Café for Open Mic until I ended up headlining
them in 2014,” she said. “I then took a break and came back in 2016 after I formed my own band; and we have been performing since then.”
