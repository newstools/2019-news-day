BY Sports Reporter The Mighty Warriors thrashed Mozambique 4-nil to record their second Group C win at the ongoing Cosafa Women’s Championships in South Africa. Veteran midfielder Marjory Nyaumwe scored on either side of the half-time break, with Emmaculate Msipa and striker Rudo Neshamba also getting on the
scoresheet. Nyaumwe converted from the spot a minute before the half-time whistle after she had been appended in the penalty box, and she stepped up to take her tournament
tally to four goals following her treble in their opening match against Angola. Having opened the scoring on nine minutes with a bullet strike, Nyaumwe was at the end of a Sheila Makoto free-kick on the 67th minute to end the rout. While it was Nyaumwe who scored the brace, it was Msipa who was voted the player of the match. Zimbabwe still have to play Eswatini but, yesterday’s win effectively booked them a ticket to the semi-finals where the challenges are set to get tough with
South Africa and Zambia in top form from their groups. Top teams from the three pools will be joined by the best second-placed team into the semis.
