Cape TOWN — SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo revealed his charges are ready for their tough season opener at the weekend. Matsatsantsa begin their 2019/2020 Premier Soccer League campaign against reigning champions Mamelodi Sundowns tomorrow. Tembo confirmed that unlike the beginning of last year’s season, he has a largely injury-free squad to chose from. “The team is in good shape,” Tembo told IOL. “We’ve avoided any major injuries and we hope that we’ll continue through the season injury-free. “Last season, we started well, but then had four of our top players out because of injuries. Our rhythm was compromised, we had to start again and find new
combinations. I think it will be a little bit different this season — we’ll have a good start this time around.” One player Tembo is hoping to rise to the Pretoria occasion is midfielder Teboho Mokoena, who was a workhorse last season. “Teboho has been tremendous, especially with all the talk about a possible transfer, and all the media speculation in that regard,” he continued. “But I’m happy that he is really focused. He has been a model professional and I know he’s going to have a really good season because he’s had a good pre-
season as well.” Sport24
