BY SHARON SIBINDI KHAYA Arts Productions is set to present their debut dance show titled Dlala, an hour-and-half-long fusion of old school and traditional dances on March 23 at the Bulawayo Theatre. The group’s founder, Future Dube, told NewsDay Life & Style that the 12-member production features Bulawayo dancer, Praise Ncube. “We have been performing in different functions organised by other people and some of our fans failed to come and see us there. We, therefore, decided to do our own show so that everyone who loves Khaya Arts will have a chance to see us live on stage,” he said. Dube said while performing different types of dances, they would also dance along to music from such icons as are celebrated in the country and outside the borders. “We will be presenting different types of dances, as well as dancing to music sung by different artistes from Zimbabwe like our late hero Dr Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi, Solomon Skuza, Ndux Malaba, Indosakusa, Jah Prayzah and many more. We expect to have a full house on the day,” he said. Khaya Arts is a music, dance and theatre company founded in 2011 and has established itself as one of the best groups in the country.
