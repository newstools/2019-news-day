BY Sports Reporter Top Zimbabwe golfer Scott Vincent pocketed $54 875 after coming fourth in the World Super 6 in Perth on Sunday. This was his biggest pay cheque for 2019, having previously collected $8 720 at the Singapore Open earlier. Vincent is approaching the $1 million mark since he started participating in the Asia Tour in 2016. His earnings have been rising steadily year after year as he made $136 811 in his first year before, following that up with $239 552 in 2017, where he managed four top 10 finishes to finish 17th in the order of merit to retain the Asia Tour card in 2018. Last year, Vincent earned $427 256 in total, with the biggest cheque coming from the Shinhan Dongae Open where he made $116 778, while earning $55 000 from the Indonesia Open. The 25-year-old has milked $867 214 from the Asia Open, easily making him the highest earning Zimbabwean sports personality. He will be competing in several tournaments this year, where he will be expected to improve his earning as his performances also improve steadily. At the weekend, Vincent had to settle for fourth place after he lost to Ireland’s Paul Dunne at the first knockout hole at the Lake Karrinyup Country Club. It was the case of so near yet so far again for Vincent. After defeating Australia’s Wade Ormsby in their opening match, the Zimbabwean took down Yuta Ikeda when he won the match 2Up against the seeded Japanese. Vincent had a crucial par putt on the second knockout hole to thank when he defeated New Zealand’s Ben Campbell to seal his passage into the semi-finals. He was, however, denied by Otaegui in the semi-final.
