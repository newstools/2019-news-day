BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO LOCAL organisers of the Literature Festival (LitFest) will tomorrow join the world in commemorating the Black History month, themed: Black Migrations, with a literary event set for Batanai Gardens in Harare. Black History month, first commemorated in 2007, is an annual event held in February by several countries around the world in remembrance of the black people who sacrificed their lives to fight white supremacy and black inferiority. In an interview with NewsDay Life &Style, LitFest director Chirikure Chirikure said tomorrow’s event was part of their outreach programme that would be hosted by seasoned writer, critic and academic Memory Chirere. “The event is going to feature readings, performances and discussions by seasoned and upcoming writers, poets and critics. Journalist ish Mafundikwa will make a presentation that will be followed by readings by writers Shimmer Chinodya and Lawrence Hoba. Albert Nyathi, Xapa, Lisa the Poet and VaChikepe the Poet will do poetry performances,” he said. “In-between presentations, the audience will be given opportunities to engage in brief discussions with the artistes. The discussions will focus on the theme Black Migrations, presentations and craft of the individual presenters.” Chirikure said the commemorations were meant to set a platform to reflect on the exodus of many Zimbabweans to the diaspora in search of greener pastures. “Over and above the broader scope of the theme, the event will be an opportunity to reflect on the migrations of people of Zimbabwean origin. Our country has seen millions of its citizens migrating to various destinations in the past few years,” he said. “We need to dialogue on the impact of this, with the discourse combining analytical and artistic approaches.” Tomorrow’s event will be supported by the public affairs section of the United States embassy and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation desk of the University of Glasgow, Scotland.
