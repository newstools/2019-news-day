BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE UNITED Methodist Church’s Masimba Edenga gospel singers group has lamented the lack of live shows as a major drawback in their quest for recognition. In an interview with NewsDay Life &Style, the group’s executive director Misheck Mukumire said they last performed at live shows in 2014, courtesy of music promoter Barbra “Mama Red Rose” Chikosi. “The group is still intact, with all 13 active young men of Vabvuwi brand, but our major challenge is lack of live shows. We have failed to organise our own shows since 2014, when Mama Red Rose last organised shows for us,” he said. “In mitigating the challenges, we have invited all stakeholders of the group and decided to form a partnership club called Masimba Edenga Partnership Club that will be running our affairs. This will be established at the launch of our 12-track DVD for the album Regerera, end of this month.” Mukumire said the group was also experiencing transport challenges since it did not have its own vehicles. Masimba Edenga group was formed in 2006 and rose to fame with their two albums, Mazambara Vols 1 and 2.
