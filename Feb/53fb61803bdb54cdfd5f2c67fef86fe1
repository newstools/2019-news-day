The Zanu PF youth league will on February 21 – the day former President Robert Mugabe turns 95 – march in Harare in  show support to President Emmerson Mnangagwa. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Addressing about 300 district youth chairperson in Marondera, the party’s National Youth League Political Commissar, Godfrey Tsenengamu, said the solidarity event is meant to send a message to the opposition parties and outside forces that Mnangagwa is a leader who was elected by the people. The march comes hardly a month after a wave of anti-government protests, and human rights organisations have have produced damning dossiers, narrating how the military fatally shot civilians at point blank, raped women and carried out nocturnal visits at perceived anti-government activists’ homes and brutally assaulted them, oftentimes in front of their families. But Mnangagwa said the rape reports were fabricated, demanding that the estimated 20 victims come out in the open and narrate their ordeals to police. Notables attending the meeting are youth league national executive memmbers Tonderai Bosha, Edmore Kandira, Mashonaland West youth league boss Vengai Musengi and Mashonaland East province youth leader Kelvin Mutsvairo. This is not the first time Zanu PF structures have marched in solidarity with their leadership. Two years ago, Zanu PF supporters staged a solidarity march in Harare to show support for the then underfire First Lady Grace Mugabe, who was facing allegations of attacking a South African model she found in a hotel socializing with her sons, Mugabe Junior and Chatunga. In November 2017, the party organised a solidarity march to show its support for  Mugabe just days after he fired Mnangagwa. More to follow
