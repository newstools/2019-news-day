BY MISHMA CHAKANYUKA CHINESE-owned ceramic company, Sunny Yi Feng, which is constructing a tile manufacturing plant in Norton, has pleaded with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) to consider waiving duty on the importation of capital equipment. Addressing journalists during a familiarisation tour of the plant on Tuesday, managing director William Gung said the company was importing machinery from China, which has to be broken into importable pieces, which he said was attracting heavy taxation from Zimra. “The machine is so big, imported in small pieces, but Zimra does not understand that,” Gung said. Industry and Commerce minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu said government had put in place a team which would work with Zimra to address the issue. “We have already instructed the team to work with Zimra so that we are able to address the challenges that the company is facing. We want to see such investments take off without any hindrances,” Ndlovu said. The factory is expected to be complete by April this year and will have the capacity to employ 1 700 people upon commencing production. The company will also produce electric cables, porcelain and poles.
