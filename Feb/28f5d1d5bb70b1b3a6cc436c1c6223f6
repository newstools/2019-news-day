BY FORTUNE MBELE ABOUT 15 athletics coaches from the southern region had, by yesterday morning, registered for the National Athletics Association (NAAZ) level two coaching course, which started at White City Stadium in Bulawayo. Bulawayo athletics board chairman Manuel Mpofu confirmed the course, which he said was also being held in Harare for coaches in the northern region, with the programme meant to prepare coaches for International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) courses that are due later this year. “So far, we have 15 coaches for the three-day course and we expect more to come in. The main objective of the course takes into account power, speed, endurance and flexibility of athletes,” he said. “At the end, the coach must be able to vary training sessions and apply those training principles for the athletes. We are also preparing the coaches to be able to attend IAAF level courses.” The programme in Bulawayo is facilitated by NAAZ director for coaching, talent identification and development, Lisimati Phakamile, who is assisted by Lizwi Ntini, a graduate of the recently held IAAF level two course, which was held at White City Stadium from January 10 to 17. Targeted coaches are from Bulawayo, Masvingo, Matabeleland North and South and participants are expected to pay $100 for the course. Phakamile was also excited about the programme. “We are preparing and grooming the coaches for the IAAF level one course. It’s a three-day course, starting today (yesterday). After the course, the coaches will be able to design training programmes and plan for and produce good athletes for the future,” Phakamile said.
