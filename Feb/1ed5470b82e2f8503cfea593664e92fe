The letter was copied to Industry minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Agriculture minister Perrance Shiri, central bank governor John Mangudya and GMAZ chairman Tafadzwa Musarara. “The GMAZ secretariat was directed to check both foreign and local wheat stocks on a daily basis required for production of bread flour….
