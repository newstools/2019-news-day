Law professor Osinbajo, who was on his way to an election campaign when the accident occurred, tweeted his thanks to the crew of the aircraft for the way they handled the situation. Following the crash the 61-year-old vice premier continued on his campaign trail for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party. He and President Muhammadu Buhari are seeking re-election on February 16. Meanwhile, at least two people have died in campaign related violence following a bloody clash between suspected APC members during a campaign rally in the Igboora area of Oyo State on Saturday night. The rally started off peacefully as Governor Abiola Ajimobi acknowledged cheers from supporters in the crowd but a clash later broke out, killing one person while another died later after being hit by a stray bullet.
