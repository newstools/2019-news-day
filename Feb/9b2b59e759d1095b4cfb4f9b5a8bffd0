BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO LOCAL fine artist Brendain Kambarazina has drawn a portrait of the late MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, as a way to remember and honour the former Prime Minister’s  immense contribution to the history of the country. The 22-year-old Kambarazina told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that the late veteran trade unionist’s contribution to the history of Zimbabwe’s politics was indelible, hence the push to draw his portrait. “When tracing the history of Zimbabwe, it would be unjust to leave Tsvangirai out of the equation. His fight for democracy since 2000 and contribution to the relative stabilisation of the country’s economy under the Government of National Unity should not go unchecked,” he said. “Although I never got an opportunity to meet him in person, his humility and love for the general populace could be felt at a distance. Looking at his attributes I have, therefore, chosen to honour him through this portrait.” Kambarazina, who recently drew a portrait of the late music icon, Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi titled Tuku Go Well, said given the opportunity, he would hand over Tsvangirai’s portrait to either his family or the MDC party. Tsvangirai died last year on Valentine’s Day after losing a two-year-long battle with colon cancer. The late veteran trade unionist, who spearheaded the formation of the MDC in 1999, became a global icon for championing democracy in Zimbabwe.
