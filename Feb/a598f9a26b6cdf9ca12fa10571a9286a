By Kevin Mapasure Matabeleland Tuskers remained winless in the Logan Cup competition after they were thrashed by an inning and 114 runs by Mountaineers in a match that concluded at Harare Sports Club yesterday. Mountaineers dominated from day one until they completed the job yesterday with their third win in this edition that enhanced their chances of taking the title. Donald Tiripano claimed a five-wicket haul in Tuskersâ€™ second innings, to finish the match with seven scalps after he had taken two in the first innings. After Mountaineers had enforced a follow-on, Tuskers could not save the match after they were bowled out for 256, which was a more decent effort compared to the first innings, where they were bundled out for 127. This was after Mountaineers had made 497 all out with Tymcem Maruma hitting 165, while Tafadzwa Tsiga was also a centurion with 124. Maruma scored 19 fours and one six after facing 255 balls before he finally perished off the bowling of Chris Mpofu caught behind. Roy Kaia weighed in with a half tone after accumulating 54 runs. Mpofu retained figures of 5 for 116, while Brian Chari took three wickets for Tuskers. Tuskers struggled with the bat, where in the first innings, their highest individual score was 34 and they only had three batsmen getting double figures. In the second innings, Chari fell 15 runs shy of a century, with national team batsman Craig Ervine making 30. Chari hit 12 boundaries in his 105 ball knock, but his efforts were only good enough to lessen the damage for his team.
