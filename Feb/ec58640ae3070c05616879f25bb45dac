BY TERRY MADYAUTA BULAWAYO CHIEFS skipper Gracious Muleya is on the verge of completing a move to Chapungu as the Airforce of Zimbabwe side aim to replace nomadic midfielder Raphael Manuvire who quit at the end of last season. Muleya was one of Chiefs’ top performers last term, where he finished as the club’s top goalscorer in a season where the Bulawayo side earned the giants killers’ tag. The versatile player has been training with Chapungu since the beginning of their pre-season last week and could soon put pen to paper to become Waru Waru’s major signing ahead of the 2019 season set to commence next month. Chapungu coach Rodwell Dhlakama said they were still to finalise the deal with the player. “We want to replace Raphael Manuvire who left. So far it’s only Gracious who is around and the bulk of our players from last season,” Dhlakama said. Tinasha Balakasi, formerly with Harare City, together Innocent Kutsanzira, formerly with relegated Bulawayo City, have also been linked with the Gweru-based side. Despite losing a promising gem, Clive Rupiya to Caps United, Chapungu recalled experienced forward Patrick Kumbula, who was on loan at Northern Region Division One side Blue Swallows.
