By Simbarashe Sithole/KENNETH NYANGANI Two people died in separate road accidents that occurred in Madziwa and Rusape at the weekend. One person died, while four others were injured when a Mazda pick-up truck they were travelling in veered off the road at the 11-kilometre peg along Madziwa-Muringamombe Road on Friday last week. The driver, Courage Kasavaya of Nyamaropa village in Madziva, reportedly failed to negotiate a curve and lost control of the vehicle, which veered off the road and overturned several times leading to Lizzy Kasavaya (50), dying on the spot. Mashonaland Central police spokesperson Inspector Milton Mundembe confirmed the accident. “I can confirm a fatal accident that killed one female passenger on the spot in Madziwa, the cause of accident was speeding and negligence,” Mundembe said. When NewsDay arrived at the scene, scores of people were helping the injured and the driver had fled from the scene. The police warned drivers to exercise extreme caution on the roads in a bid to save lives. Meanwhile, a six-year-old boy from Rusape died after falling from the scorch-cart on Saturday. Manicaland police spokesperson Inspector Tavhiringwa Kakokwa confirmed the incident yesterday. Kakokwa said Believe Zimbodza (6) was riding in a scorch-cart that was being led by his 14-year-old brother on their way to fetch firewood in village 21 under Chief Chikoore in Mayo, Rusape district. One of the wheels rammed into a tree-log and the now deceased was thrown out and landed on his head. He started to bleed profusely from the mouth and nose and fell unconscious. The deceased’s brother rushed home and told his mother Sheila Mbore (34), who then took the minor to Mayo Clinic, where he was pronounced dead on admission.
