BY Sports Reporter Pictures emerged on social media yesterday of purported samples of the Warriors kits that Umbro has tabled for Zifa to pick from. Zifa and Umbro recently signed a three-year deal where the English kit manufacturers will dress all national teams. At the time of the announcement, the two parties said Umbro was going back to come up with the designs, taking into account what Zifa suggested. From the pictures that emerged yesterday, the one with the national flag colours caused a stir as it was likened to the popular scarf that has become President Emerson Mnangagwa’s trademark. Zifa spokesperson, Xolisani Gwesela, however, said he was not aware of the origins of the pictures. From the designs, it looks like Zifa want to have a predominantly gold kit for home matches with red swashes. The colour combination is like the one for the national cricket team, though that one has red as the dominant colour while there is gold as well. The away strip should be predominantly green, while they have retained the white strip as the alternative kit. The Zimbabwe senior national team will be the first national team to use the new kit when they take on Congo Brazaville in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier (Afcon) at the National Sports Stadium next month. The Warriors need just one point to qualify for the Afcon finals that will be played in Egypt between June and July. If Zimbabwe qualify for this year’s finals, it will be the fourth time that they will be making it to the continental showpiece. Before the Afcon finals, Zimbabwe will participate in the Cosafa Cup, which they will host in May. The Sunday Chidzambga-coached side will be looking to win the regional title for the seventh time. Last year, Zifa parted with Mafro, who dressed the national teams since Afcon 2017 in Gabon. After dumping Mafro, the national teams have been using unbranded kits and the coming in of Umbro saw the Felton Kamambo-led Zifa board earn a lot of praise.
