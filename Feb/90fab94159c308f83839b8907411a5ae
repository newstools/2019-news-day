BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO THE National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ) is inviting artworks from local female artists and those in the diaspora for this year’s women’s exhibition titled Balance for Better: Redesigning the Woman’s Space, running from March 22 to May 20 in Harare. In a statement, NGZ deputy director and chief curator Raphael Chikukwa said the deadline for submission is March 15.
Chikukwa said the exhibitors would display works that explore and critically analyse the place and space of women in Zimbabwe, Africa and the world today as espoused in the curation brief. “The gallery calls on women artists to consider these different sides of the theme and to allow themselves to dream and consider the place and space both traditionally and futuristically that women may embrace or lean toward,” he said. “Such a space is naturally influenced by a myriad of considerations, including religion, traditional beliefs, norms and mores, as well as the contemporary arena which we presently occupy.” Chikukwa said the exhibition would constitute several programmes that help to further explore the theme and will be supported through a variety of public programmes designed
to further interrogate various aspects that impact the lives of women. Chikukwa said interested artists can send the soft copy documents, that should be in PDF format in the listed order and format to v.sithole@nationalgallery.co.zw with the subject Balance for Better: Redesigning the Woman’s Space and name of applicant, while hard copy documents must be addressed to Walter Ndundu, National Gallery of Zimbabwe,
20 Julius Nyerere Way, Harare, Zimbabwe and indicate the top right hand corner: “Balance of Better: Redesigning the Woman’s Space, Submission, March 2019”. More information regarding submission rules, guidelines and format requirements is accessible on the NGZ’s Facebook and Instagram social media platforms.
