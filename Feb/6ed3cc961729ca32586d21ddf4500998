BY TERRY MADYAUTA Premier Soccer League new boys, TelOne FC, have assured Joel Lupahla that his place in the team’s technical department is safe amid murmurs that there were plans to cut ties with the former Warriors forward. Lupahla does not have the mandatory Caf A coaching badge and, therefore, cannot be head of the technical team, according to Zifa’s new requirements. Lupahla, is set to be re-assigned to a technical advisory role once the club appoints a new coach. TelOne spokesperson Melody Harry told the NewsDay Sport yesterday that the club has identified their target and that negotiations are at an advanced stage to bring him on board. “We have identified the coach to take up the job and as we speak negotiations are at an advanced stage. This is our maiden season in the Premier League and our hope is to do well. Therefore, for continuity purposes we want to maintain the structure we have in place. Lupahla is assured of his place in the technical department, for the sake of continuity,” she said. “The person to be appointed will work hand in glove with the rest of the technical team,” she added. Former Young Warriors gaffer Jairos Tapera has been tipped to take over the job after impressing during the interviews held last month. However, it is alleged that some members of the technical team are not keen on working with Tapera and prefer Nelson Matongorere instead. Matongorere is currently part of the Caps United technical team.
